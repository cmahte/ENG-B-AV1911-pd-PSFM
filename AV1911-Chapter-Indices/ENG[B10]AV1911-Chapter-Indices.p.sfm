\cd 3 The Apostle encourages them against troubles, by the comforts and deliverances which God had given him, as in all his afflictions, 8 so particularly in his late danger in Asia. 12 And calling both his own conscience, and theirs to witness, of his sincere manner of preaching the immutable truth of the Gospel, 15 He excuses his not coming to them, as proceeding not of lightness, but of his lenity towards them.
\c 2
\cl CHAP. II.
\cd 1 Having shown the reason why he came not to them, 6 He requires them to forgive and to comfort that excommunicated person, 10 Even as himself also upon his true repentance had forgiven him, 12 declaring withal why he departed from Troas to Macedonia, 14 and the happy success which God gave to his preaching in all places.
\c 3
\cl CHAP. III.
\cd 1 Lest their false teachers should charge him with vaineglory, he shows the faith and graces of the Corinthians, to be a sufficient commendation of his ministery. 6 Whereupon entring a comparison between the ministers of the Law and of the Gospel, 12 he proves that his ministery is so far the more excellent, as the Gospel of life and liberty is more glorious then the law of condemnation.
\c 4
\cl CHAP. IIII.
\cd 1 He declares how he has used all sincerity and faithful diligence in preaching the Gospel, 7 and how the troubles and persecutions which he dayly indured for the same, did redound to the praise of God's power, 12 to the benefit of the Church, 16 and to the Apostles own eternal glory.
\c 5
\cl CHAP. V.
\cd 1 That in his assured hope of immortal glory, 9 and in expectance of it, and of the general judgement, he labors to keep a good conscience, 12 not that he may herein boast of himself, 14 but as one that having received life from Christ, endeavors to Hue as a new creature to Christ only, 18 and by his ministry of reconciliation to reconcile others also in Christ to God.
\c 6
\cl CHAP. VI.
\cd 1 That he has approved himself a faithful minister of Christ, both by his exhortations, 3 and by integrity of life, 4 and by patient enduring all kinds of affliction and disgraces for the Gospel. 10 Of which he speaks the more boldly amongst them, because his heart is open to them, 13 And he expects the like affection from them again, 14 Exhorting to flee the society and pollutions of Idolaters, as being themselves Temples of the living God.
\c 7
\cl CHAP. VII.
\cd 1 He proceeds in exhorting them to purity of life, 2 and to bear him like affection as he does to them. 3 Whereof, lest he might seeme to doubt, he declares what comfort he took in his afflictions, by the report which Titus gave of their godly sorrow, which his former Epistle had wrought in them, 13 and of their loving kindness and obedience towards Titus, answerable to his former boastings of them.
\c 8
\cl CHAP. VIII.
\cd 1 He stirs them up to a liberal contribution for the poor Saints at Jerusalem, by the example of the Macedonians, 7 by commendation of their former forwardness, 9 by the example of Christ, 14 and by the spiritual profit that shall redound to themselves thereby: 16 Commending to them the integrity and willingness of Titus, and those other brethren, who upon his request, exhortation and commendation, were purposely come to them for this business.
\c 9
\cl CHAP. IX.
\cd 1 He yields the reason why, though he knew their forwardness, yet he sent Titus and his brethren before hand. 6 And he proceeds in stirring them up to a bountiful alms, as being but a kind of sowing of seed, 10 which shall return a great increase to them, 13 and occasion a great sacrifice of thanksgivings unto God.
\c 10
\cl CHAP. X.
\cd 1 Against the false Apostles, who disgraced the weakness of his person and bodily presence, he sets out the spiritual might and authority, with which he is armed against all adversary powers, 7 assuring them that at his coming he will be found as mighty in word, as he is now in writing being absent, 12 And withal taxing them for reaching out themselves beyond their compass, and vanting theselves into other mens labors.
\c 11
\cl CHAP. XI.
\cd 1 Out of his jealousy over the Corinthians, who seemed to make more account of the false apostles, then of him, he enters into a forced commendation of himself, 5 of his equality with the chief Apostles, 7 of his preaching the Gospel to them freely, and without any their charge, 13 showing that he was not inferiour to those deceitful workers, in any legal prerogative, 23 and in the service of Christ, and in all kind of sufferings for his ministery, far superiour.
\c 12
\cl CHAP. XII.
\cd 1 For commending of his Apostleship, though he might glory of his wonderful revelations, 9 Yet he rather chooses to glory of his infirmities, 11 blaming them for forcing him to this vain boasting. 14 He promises to come to them again: but yet altogether in the affedion of a father, 20 although he fears he shall to his grief find many offenders, and public disorders there.
\c 13
