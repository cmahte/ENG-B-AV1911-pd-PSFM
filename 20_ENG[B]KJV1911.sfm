\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 THE proverbs of Solomon the son of David, king of Israel;
\p
\v 2 To know wisdom and instruction; to perceive the words of understanding;
\p
\v 3 To receive the instruction of wisdom, righteousness, justice, and equity;
\p
\v 4 To give subtlety to the simple, to the young man knovdedge and discretion.
\p
\v 5 A wise man will hear, and will increase learning; and a man of understanding shall attain unto wise counsels:
\p
\v 6 To understand a proverb, and the interpretation; the words of the wise, and their dark sayings.
\p
\v 7 The fear of the LORD is the beginning of knowledge; hut fools despise wisdom and instruction.
\p
\v 8 My son, hear the instruction of thy father, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
\p
\v 9 For they shall fee an ornament of grace unto thy head, and chains about thy neck.
\p
\v 10 My son, if sinners entice thee, consent thou not.
\p
\v 11 If they say, Come with us, let us lay wait for blood, let us lurk privily for the innocent witJiout cause:
\p
\v 12 Let us swallow them up alive as ithe grave; and whole, as those that go down into the pit:
\p
\v 13 We shall find all precious substance, we shall fill our houses with spoil:
\p
\v 14 Cast in thy lot among us; let us all have one purse:
\p
\v 15 My son, walk not thou in the way with them; refrain thy foot from their path:
\p
\v 16 For their feet run to evil, and make haste to shed blood.
\p
\v 17 Surely in vain the net is spread in the sight of any bird.
\p
\v 18 And they lay wait for their own blood; they lurk privily for their own lives.
\p
\v 19 So are the ways of every one that is greedy of gain; who taketh away the life of the owners thereof.
\p
\v 20 Wisdom crieth without; she uttereth her voice in the streets:
\p
\v 21 She crieth in the chief place of concourse, in the openings of the gates: in the city she uttereth her words, saying,
\p
\v 22 How long, ye simple ones, will ye love simplicity? and the scorners delight in their scorning, and fools hate knowledge?
\p
\v 23 Turn you at my reproof: behold, I will pour out my spirit unto you, I will make known my words unto you.
\p
\v 24 Because I have called, and ye refused; I have stretched out my hand, and no man regarded;
\p
\v 25 But ye have set at naught all my counsel, and would none of my reproof:
\p
\v 26 I also will laugh at your calamity; I will mock when your fear cometh;
\p
\v 27 When your fear cometh as desolation, and your destruction cometh as a whirlwind; when distress and anguish cometh upon you.
\p
\v 28 Then shall they call upon me, but I will not answer; they shall seek me earnestly, but they shall not find me:
\p
\v 29 For that they hated knovledge, and did not choose the fear of the LORD:
\p
\v 30 They would none of my counsel: they despised all my reproof.
\p
\v 31 Therefore shall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own devices.
\p
\v 32 For the turning away of the simple shall slay them, and the prosperity of fools shall destroy them.
\p
\v 33 But wlioso hearkeneth unto me shall dwell safely, and shall be quiet from fear of evil.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 MY son, if thou wilt receive my words, and hide my commandments with thee;
\p
\v 2 So that thou incline thine ear unto wisdom, and apply thine heart to understanding;
\p
\v 3 Yea, if thou criest after knowledge, aTid liftest up thy voice for understanding;
\p
\v 4 If thou seekest her as silver, and searchest for her as for hid treasures;
\p
\v 5 Then shalt thou understand the fear of the Lord, and find the i’knowiedge of God.
\p
\v 6 For the LORD giveth wisdom: out of his mouth comefh knowledge and understanding.
\p
\v 7 He layeth up sound wisdom for the righteous: he is a buckler to them that walk uprightly.
\p
\v 8 iHe keepeth the paths of judgment, and preserveth the way of his saints.
\p
\v 9 Then shalt thou understand righteousness, and judgment, and equity; yea, every good path.
\p
\v 10 When wisdom entereth into thine heart, and knowledge will be pleasant unto thy soul;
\p
\v 11 Discretion shall preserve thee, understanding shall keep thee i
\p
\v 12 To deliver thee from the way of the evil man, from the man that speak eth fro ward things;
\p
\v 13 Who leave the paths of uprightness, to walk in the ways of darkness;
\p
\v 14 Who rejoice to do evil, and delight in the frowardness of the wicked;
\p
\v 15 Whose ways are crooked, and they froward in their paths:
\p
\v 16 To deliver theefrom the strange woman, even from the stranger that y flattereth with her words;
\p
\v 17 Who forsaketh the guide of her - youth, and forgetteth the covenant of her God.
\p
\v 18 For her house sinketh unto death, and her paths unto the dead.
\p
\v 19 None that go unto her return again, neither take they bold of the paths of life.
\p
\v 20 That thou may est walk in the way of good men, and keep the paths of the righteous.
\p
\v 21 For the upright shall dwell in the land, and the perfect shall remain in iti
\p
\v 22 But the wicked shall be cut off from the earth, and the transgressors shall be rooted out of it.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 MY son, forget not my instruction; but let thine heart keep my commandments:
\p
\v 2 For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.
\p
\v 3 Let not mercy and truth forsake thee: bind them about thy neck; write them upon the table of thine heart:
\p
\v 4 So shalt thou find favour and good favour in the sight of God and man.
\p
\v 5 Trust in the Lord with all thine heart; and lean not upon thine own understanding.
\p
\v 6 In ail thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.
\p
\v 7 Be not wise in thine own eyes: fear the LORD, and depart from evil.
\p
\v 8 It shall be health to thy navel, and marrow to thy bones.
\p
\v 9 Honour the Lord with thy substance, and with the firstfruits of all thine increase:
\p
\v 10 So shall thy barns be filled with plenty, and thy presses shall burst out with new wine.
\p
\v 11 My son, despise not the chastening of the Lord; neither be weary of bis correction:
\p
\v 12 For whom the Lord loveth he correcteth; even as a father the son in whom he delighteth.
\p
\v 13 Happy is the man that findeth wisdom, and the man that getteth understanding.
\p
\v 14 For the merchandise of it is better than the merchandise of silver, and the gain thereof than fine gold.
\p
\v 15 She is more .precious than rubies: and all the things thou canst desire are not to be compared unto her.
\p
\v 16 Length of days is in her right hand; and in her left hand riches and honour.
\p
\v 17 Her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are . peace.
\p
\v 18 She is a tree of life to them that lay hold upon her: and happy is every one that retaineth her.
\p
\v 19 The Lord by wisdom hath founded the earth; by understanding hath he established the heavens.
\p
\v 20 By his knowledge the depths were broken up, and the skies drop down the dew.
\p
\v 21 My son, let not them depart from thine eyes: keep sound wisdom and discretion:
\p
\v 22 So shall they be life unto thy soul, and grace to thy neck.
\p
\v 23 Then shalt thou walk in thy way safely, and thy foot shall not stumble.
\p
\v 24 When thou liest down, thou shalt not be afraid: yea, thou shalt lie down, and thy sleep shall be sweet.
\p
\v 25 Be not afraid of sudden fear, neither of the desolation of the wicked, when it cometh.
\p
\v 26 For the LORD shall be thy confidence, and shall !7keep thy foot from being taken.
\p
\v 27 Withhold not good from them to whom it is due, when it is in the power of thine hand to do it.
\p
\v 28 Say not unto thy neighbour. Go, and come again, and to morrow I will give; when thou hast it by thee.
\p
\v 29 Devise not evil against thy neighbour, seeing he dwelleth securely by thee.
\p
\v 30 Strive not with a man without cause, if he have done thee no harm.
\p
\v 31 Envy thou not the violent man, and choose none of his ways.
\p
\v 33 For the froward is abomination to the Lord: but his secret is with the righteous.
\p
\v 33 The - curse of the LORD is ip the house of the wicked: but he blesseth the habitation of the just.
\p
\v 34 Surely he scorneth the scorners: but he giveth grace unto the lowly.
\p
\v 35 The wise shall inherit ' glory: but shame shall be the portion of fools.

\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 HEAR, ye children, the instruction of a father, and attend to know understanding.
\p
\v 2 For I give you good doctrine, forsake ye not my instruction.
\p
\v 3 For I was my father’s son, tender and only beloved in the sight of my mother.
\p
\v 4 He taught me also, and said unto me, Let thine heart retain my words: keep my commandments, and live.
\p
\v 5 Get wisdom, get understanding: forget it not; neither decline from the words of my mouth.
\p
\v 6 Forsake her not, and she shall •preserve thee: love her, and she shall keep thee.
\p
\v 7 Wisdom is the principal thing; therefore get wisdom: and with all thy getting get understanding.
\p
\v 8 Exalt her, and she shall promote thee: she shall bring thee to honour, when thou dost embrace her.
\p
\v 9 She shall give to thine head an ornament of grace: a crown of glory shall she deliver to thee.
\p
\v 10 Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings; and the years of thy life shall be many.
\p
\v 11 I have taught thee in the way of wisdom; I have led thee in right paths.
\p
\v 12 When thou gorst, thy steps shall not be straitened; and when thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.
\p
\v 13 Take fast hold of instruction; let her not go: keep her; for she is thy life.
\p
\v 14 Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men.
\p
\v 15 Avoid it, pass not by it, turn from it, and pass away.
\p
\v 16 For they sleep not, except they have done mischief; and their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.
\p
\v 17 For they eat the sbread of wickedness, and drink the wine of violence.
\p
\v 18 But the path of the righteous is as the shining light, that yshineth more and more unto the perfect day.
\p
\v 19 The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble.
\p
\v 20 My son, attend to my words; incline thine ear unto my sayings.
\p
\v 21 Let them not depart from thine eyes; keep them in the midst of thine heart.
\p
\v 22 For they are life unto those that find them, and health to all their flesh.
\p
\v 23 Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life.
\p
\v 24 Put away from thee a fro ward mouth, and perverse lips put far from thee.
\p
\v 25 Let thine eyes look right on, and let thine eyelids look straight before thee.
\p
\v 26 Ponder the path of thy feet, and let all thy ways be established.
\p
\v 27 Turn not to the right hand nor to the left: remove thy foot from evil.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 MY son, attend unto my wisdom, and bow thine ear to my understanding:
\p
\v 2 That thou mayest regard discretion, and that thy lips may keep knowledge.
\p
\v 3 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil:
\p
\v 4 But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a twoedged sword.
\p
\v 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on ihell.
\p
\v 6 Lest thou shouldest ponder the path of life, her ways are shifting, that thou canst not know them.
\p
\v 7 Hear me now therefore, O ye children, and depart not from the words of my mouth,
\p
\v 8 Remove thy way far from her, and come not nigh the door of her house:
\p
\v 9 Lest thou give thine honour unto others, and thy years unto the cruel:
\p
\v 10 Lest strangers be filled with thy wealth; and thy labours be in the house of a stranger;
\p
\v 11 And thou mourn at the last, when thy flesh and thy body are consumed,
\p
\v 12 And say, How have I hated instruction, and my heart despised reproof;
\p
\v 13 And have not obeyed the voice of my teachers, nor inclined mine ear to them that instructed me !
\p
\v 14 I was almost in all evil in the midst of the congregation and assembly.
\p
\v 15 Drink waters out of thine own cistern, and running waters out of thine own well.
\p
\v 16 Let thy fountains be .'dispersed abroad, and rivers of waters in the streets.
\p
\v 17 Let them be only thine own, and not strangers' with thee.
\p
\v 18 Let thy fountain be blessed: and rejoice in the wife of thy youth.
\p
\v 19 Let her be as the lovely gazelle and the graceful doe; let her breasts satisfy thee at all times; with her love be thou ravished continually.
\p
\v 20 And why wilt thou, my son, be ravished with a strange woman, and embrace the bosom of a stranger ?
\p
\v 21 For the ways of man are before the eyes of the LORD, and he pondereth all his goings.
\p
\v 22 His own iniquities shall take the wicked himself, and he shall be holden with the cords of his sins.
\p
\v 33 He shall die without instruction; and in the greatness of his folly he shall go astray.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 MY son, if thou hast become surety for thy friend, if thou hast stricken thy hand with a stranger,
\p
\v 2 Thou art snared with the words of thy mouth, thou art taken with the words of thy mouth.
\p
\v 3 Do this now, my son, and deliver thyself, since thou art come into the hand of thy friend; go, hasten to humble thyself, and make sure thy friend.
\p
\v 4 Give not sleep to thine eyes, nor •slumber to thine eyelids.
\p
\v 5 Deliver thyself as a roe from the hand of the hunter, and as a bird from the hand of the fowler.
\p
\v 6 Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and b© wise:
\p
\v 7 Which having no guide, overseer, or ruler,
\p
\v 8 Provideth her meat in the summer, and gathereth her food in the harvest.
\p
\v 9 How long wilt thou sleep, O s sluggard? when wilt thou arise out of thy sleep ?
\p
\v 10 Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the hands to sleep:
\p
\v 11 So shall thy poverty come as one that travelleth, and thy want as an armed man.
\p
\v 12 A naughty person, a wicked man, waiketh with a froward mouth.
\p
\v 13 He winketh with his eyes, he speaketh with his feet, he teacheth with his fingers;
\p
\v 14 Frowardness is in his heart, he deviseth mischief continually; he soweth discord.
\p
\v 15 Therefore shall his calamity come suddenly; suddenly shall he be broken without remedy.
\p
\v 16 These six things doth the LORD hate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him:
\p
\v 17 A proud look, a lying tongue, and hands that shed innocent blood,
\p
\v 18 An heart that deviseth wicked imaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief,
\p
\v 19 A false witness that speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren.
\p
\v 20 My son, keep thy father’s com.mandment, and forsake not the law of thy mother:
\p
\v 21 Bind them continually upon thine heart, tie them about thy neck.
\p
\v 22 When thou goest, it shall lead thee; when thou sleepest, it shall keep thee; and when thou awakest, it shall talk with thee.
\p
\v 23 For the commandment is a lamp; and the law is light; and reproofs of instruction are the way of life:
\p
\v 24 To keep thee from the evil woman, from the flattery of the tongue of a strange woman.
\p
\v 25 Lust not after her beauty in thine heart; neither let her take thee with her eyelids.
\p
\v 26 For by means of a whorish woman a man is brought to a piece of bread: and the adulteress will hunt for the precious life.
\p
\v 27 Can a man take fire in his bosom, and his clothes not be burned?
\p
\v 28 Can one go upon hot coals, and his feet not be burned ?
\p
\v 29 So he that goeth in to his neighbour’s wife; whosoever toucheth her shall not be innocent.
\p
\v 30 Men do not despise a thief, if he steal to satisfy his soul when he is hungry;
\p
\v 31 But if he be found, he shall restore sevenfold; he shall give all the substance of his house.
\p
\v 32 jBzz whoso committeth adultery with a woman lacketh understanding: he that doeth it destroy eth his own soul.
\p
\v 33 A wound and dishonour shall he get; and his reproach shall not be wiped away.
\p
\v 34 For jealousy is the rage of a man: therefore he will not spare in the day of vengeance.
\p
\v 35 He will not regard any ransom; neither will he rest content, though thou givest many gifts.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 MY son, keep my words, and lay up my commandments with thee.
\p
\v 2 Keep my commandments, and live; and my law as the apple of thine eye.
\p
\v 3 Bind them upon thy fingers, write them upon the table of thine heart.
\p
\v 4 Say unto wisdom, Thou art my sister; and call understanding thy kinswoman:
\p
\v 5 That they may keep thee from the strange woman, from the stranger that fiattereth with her words.
\p
\v 6 For at the window of my house I looked through my casement,
\p
\v 7 And beheld among the simple ones, I discerned among the youths, a young man void of understanding,
\p
\v 8 Passing through the street near her corner; and he went the way to her house,
\p
\v 9 In the twilight, in the evening, in the black and dark night:
\p
\v 10 And, behold, there met him a woman with the attire of an harlot, and subtle of heart.
\p
\v 11 (She is loud and stubborn; her feet abide not in her house:
\p
\v 12 Now is she without, now in the streets, and lieth in wait at every corner.)
\p
\v 13 So she caught him, and kissed him, and with an impudent face said unto him,
\p
\v 14 lave peace offerings v\rith me; this day have I paid my ■Tvows.
\p
\v 15 Therefore came I forth to meet thee, diligently to seek thy face, and { I have found thee.
\p
\v 16 I have decked my bed with coverings of tapestry, with carved works, with fine linen of Egypt.
\p
\v 17 I have perfumed my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon.
\p
\v 18' Come, let us take our fill of love until the morning: let us indulge ourselves with loves.
\p
\v 19 For the goodman is not ft home, he is gone a long journey:
\p
\v 20 He hath taken a bag of . money with him, and will come home at the new moon feast.
\p
\v 21 With her much fair speech she caused him to yield, with the flattering of her lips she forced him.
\p
\v 22 He goeth after her quickly, as an ox goeth to the slaughter, or as a fool to the correction of the stocks;
\p
\v 23 Till a dart strike through his liver; as a bird hasteth to the snare, and knoweth not that it is for his life.
\p
\v 24 Hearken unto me now therefore, O ye children, and attend to the words of my mouth.
\p
\v 25 Let not thine heart decline to her ways, go not astray in her paths.
\p
\v 26 For she hath cast down many wounded: yea, many strong men have been slain by her.
\p
\v 27 Her house is the way to ihell, going down to the chambers of death.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 DOTH not wisdom cry, and understanding put forth her voice?
\p
\v 2 On the top of high places by the wayside, in the midst of the streets, she takes her stand;
\p
\v 3 Beside the gateways, at the entrance of the city, at the coming in at the gates, she crieth aloud:
\p
\v 4 Unto you, O men, I call; and my voice is to the sons of men.
\p
\v 5 O ye simple, understand wisdom: and, ye fooi, be ye of an understanding heart.
\p
\v 6 Hear; for I will speak of excellent things; and the opening of my lips shall be right things.
\p
\v 7 For my mouth shall speak truth; and wickedness is an abomination to my lips.
\p
\v 8 All the words of my mouth are in righteousness; there is nothing crooked or perverse in them.
\p
\v 9 They are all plain to him that understandeth, and right to them that find knowledge.
\p
\v 10 Receive my instruction, and not silver; and knowledge rather than choice gold.
\p
\v 11 For wisdom is better than irubies; and all the things that may be desired are not to be compared to her.
\p
\v 12 I wisdom dwell with prudence, and find out knowledge of discreet thoughts*
\p
\v 13 The fear of the Lord is to hate evil: pride, and arrogancy, and the evil way, and the froward mouth, do I hate.
\p
\v 14 Counsel is miile, and sound Wisdom: I am understanding; I have strength.
\p
\v 15 By me kings reign, and princes decree justice.
\p
\v 16 By me princes rule, and nobles, evert all the judges of the earth.
\p
\v 17 I love them that love me; and those that seek me early shall find me,
\p
\v 18 Riches aiid honour are with me; yea, durable riches and righteousness.
\p
\v 19 My fruit is better than gold, yea, than fine gold; and my revenue than choice . silver.
\p
\v 20 I lead in the way of rightedtisness, in the midst of the paths df judgment:
\p
\v 21 That I may cause those that love me to inherit substance; and I will fill their treasures.
\p
\v 22 The Lord possessed me in the beginning of his way, before his works of old.
\p
\v 23 I was set up from everlasting, from the beginning, or ever the earth was.
\p
\v 24 When there were no depths, I was brought forth; when there were no fountains abounding with water.
\p
\v 25 Before the mountains were settled, before the hills was I brought forth:
\p
\v 26 While as yet he had lidt made the earth, nor the fields, nor the highest part of tb«? dust of the world.
\p
\v 27 When he prtjfHred the heavens, I was there: when he set a compass upon the face of the depth:
\p
\v 28 When he established the clouds above: when he strengthened the fountains of the deep:
\p
\v 29 When he gave to the sefi its decree, that the waters should not pass his commandment: when he appointed the foundations of the earth:
\p
\v 30 Then I was by him, as one brought up with him: and I was daily his delight, rejoicing always before him;
\p
\v 31 Rejoicing in the habitable part of his earth; and my delights were with the sons of men.
\p
\v 32 Now therefore hearken unto me, O ye children: for blessed are they that keep my ways.
\p
\v 33 Hear instruction, and be wise, and refuse it not.
\p
\v 34 Blessed is the man that heareth me, watching daily at my gates, waiting at the posts of my doors.
\p
\v 35 For whoso findeth me findeth life, and shall obtain favour of the Lord.
\p
\v 36 But he that sinneth against me ? wrongeth his own soul: all they that hate me love death.

\p
\v 1 TXriSDOM hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars:
\p
\v 2 She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
\p
\v 3 She hath sent forth her maidens: she crieth upon the highest places of the city,
\p
\v 4 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
\p
\v 5 Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
\p
\v 6 Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
\p
\v 7 He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame: and he that rebliketh a wicked Ttian getteth himself a blot.
\p
\v 8 Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee: rebuke a wise man, and he will love thee.
\p
\v 9 Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser: teach a just man, and he will increase in learning.
\p
\v 10 The fear of the Lord is the y beginning of wisdom: and the knowledge of the holy is understanding.
\p
\v 11 For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
\p
\v 12 If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself: but if thou scornest, thou alone shalt bear it.
\p
\v 13 The foolish woman is restless; she is s silly and knoweth nothing.
\p
\v 14 For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
\p
\v 15 To call passengers who go right on their ways:
\p
\v 16 Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither: and as for him that wanteth understanding, she saith to him,
\p
\v 17 Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
\p
\v 18 But he knoweth not that the
\p
\v 10 dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of i hell,

\v 1 THE « proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father: but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother.
\p
\v 2 Treasures of wickedness profit nothing: but righteousness delivereth from death.
\p
\v 3 The Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish: but he casteth away the substance of the wicked.
\p
\v 4 He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand: but the hand of the diligent maketh rich.
\p
\v 5 He that gathereth in summer is a wise son: but he that sleepeth in harvest is a son that causeth shame.
\p
\v 6 Blessings are upon the head of the just: but violence covereth the mouth ot the wicked.
\p
\v 7 The memory of the just is blessed: but the name of the wicked shall rot.
\p
\v 8 The wise in heart will receive commandments: but a prating fool shall fall.
\p
\v 9 He that walketh uprightly walketh surely: but he that perverteth his ways shall be known.
\p
\v 10 He that winketh with the .eye causeth sorrow: but a prating fool shall fall.
\p

\p
\v 3 The foolishness of man perverteth his way: and his heart fretteth against the LORD.

\v 4 Wealth maketh many friends; but the poor is separated from his neighbour.
\p
\v 5 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall not escape.

\v 6 Many will entreat the favour of the prince: and every man is a friend to him that giveth gifts.
\p
\v 7 All the brethren of the poor do hate him: how much more do his friends go far from him? he pursueth them with words, but they are vanished.
\p
\v 8 He that gfetteth wisdom loveth his own soul: he that keepeth understanding shall find good.

\v 9 A false witness shall not be unpunished, and he that speaketh lies shall perish.

\v 10 Delight is not seemly for a fool; much less for a servant to have rule over princes.

\v 12 The king’s wrath is as the roaring of a lion; but his favour is as dew upon the grass.

\v 13 A foolish son is the calamity of his father: and the contentions of a wife are a continual dropping.

\v 25 if is a snare to the man who devoureth that which is holy, and after vows to make inquiry.

\v 2 Every way of a man is right in his own eyes: but the Lord pondereth the heartSi
\p
\v 3 To do justice and judgment is more acceptable to the Lord than sacrifice.
\p
\v 4 An high look, and a proud heart, and the plowing of the wicked, is sin.
\p
\v 5 The thoughts of the diligent tend only to plenteousness; but of every one that is hasty only to want.
\p
\v 6 The getting of treasures by a lying tongue is a vapour tossed to and fro of them that seek death.

\v 8 Self-willed is the way of the estranged man; as for the pure, his work is upfight.
\p
\v 9 It is better to dwell in a corner of the housetop, than with a brawling woman in a wide house.

\v 10 The soul of the wicked desireth evil: his neighbour findeth no favour in his eyes.
\p
\v 11 When the scomer is punished, the simple is made wise: and when the wise is instructed, he receiveth knowledge.
\p
\v 12 The righteous man wisely considereth the house of the wicked: but God overthroweth the wicked for their wickedness.
\p
\v 13 Whoso stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor, he also shall cry himself, but shall not be heard.

\v 8 As a bird that wandereth frOtll her nest, so is a man that wandereth from his place.
\p
\v 9 Ointment and perfume rejoice the heart: so doth the sweetness Of a man’s friend by hearty counsel.
\p
\v 10 Thine own friend, and thy father’s friend, forsake not; neither go into thy brother’s house in the day of thy calamity: for better is a neighbour that is near than a brother far off.
\p
\v 11 My son, be wise, and make my heart glad, that I may answer him that b’reproacheth me.
\p
\v 12 A prudent man foreseeth the evil, and hideth himself; hut the simple pass on, and are punished.
\p
\v 13 Take his garment that is surety for a stranger, and take a pledge of him for a strange woman.
\p
\v 14 He that blesseth his friend with a loud voice, rising early in the morning, it shall be counted a curse to him.
\p
\v 15 A continual dropping in a very rainy day and a contentious woman are alike.
\p
\v 16 Whosoever hideth her hideth the wind, and the ointment of his right hand, which bewrayeth itself.
\p
\v 17 Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.
\p
\v 18 Whoso keepeth the -'fig tree shall eat the fruit thereof: so he that waiteth on his master shall be honoured.
\p
\v 19 As in water face answereth to face, so the heart of man to man.
\p
\v 20 1 Hell and destruction are never full; so the eyes of man are never satisfied.
\p
\v 21 As the fining pot for silver, and the furnace for gold; so is a man tested when he is praised.
\p
\v 22 Though thou shouldest bruise a fool in a mortar among wheat with a pestle, yet will not his foolishness depart from him.
\p
\v 23 Be thou diligent to know the state of thy flocks, and look well to thy herds.
\p
\v 24 For riches are not for ever: and doth the crown endure to every generation ?
\p
\v 25 The hay appeareth, and the tender grass showeth itself, and herbs of the mountains are gathered.
\p
\v 26 The lambs are for thy clothing, and the goats are the price of the field.
\p
\v 27 And thou shalt have goats' milk enough for thy food, for the food of thy household, and for the maintenance for thy maidens.

\cl CHAPTER 28
\p
\v 1 THE wicked flee when no man pursueth: but the righteous are bold as a lion.
\p
\v 2 For the transgression of a land many are the princes thereof: but by a man of understanding and knowledge the state thereof shall be prolonged.
\p
\v 3 A poor man that oppresseth the poor is like a sweeping rain which leaveth no food.
\p
\v 4 They that forsake the law praise the wicked: but such as keep the law contend with them.
\p
\v 5 Evil men understand not judgment: but they that seek the LORD understand all things.
\p
\v 6 Better is the poor that walketh in his uprightness, than he that is perverse in his ways, though he he rich.
\p
\v 7 Whoso keepeth the law is a wise son: but he that is a companion of riotous men shameth his father.
\p
\v 8 He that by usury and unjust gain increaseth his substance, he shall gather it for him that will pity the poor.
\p
\v 9 He that turneth away his ear from hearing the law, even his prayer shall he abomination.
\p
\v 10 Whoso causeth the righteous to go astray in an evil way, he shall fall himself into his own pit: but the upright shall have good things in possession.
\p
\v 11 The rich man is wise in his own conceit; but the poor that hath understanding searcheth him out.
\p
\v 12 When righteous men do rejoice, there is great .'glory: but when the wicked rise, a man is hidden.
\p
\v 13 He that covereth his sins shall not prosper: but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy.
\p
\v 14 Happy is the man that feareth alway: but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief.
\p
\v 15 As a roaring lion, and a ranging bear; so is a wicked ruler over the poor people.
\p
\v 16 The prince that is void of understanding is also a great oppressor: hut he that hateth covetousness shall prolong his days.
\p
\v 17 A man burdened with the blood of any person shall flee to the pit; let no man stay him.
\p
\v 18 Whoso walketh uprightly shall be saved: but he that is perverse in his ways shall fall at once.
\p
\v 19 He that tilleth his land shall have plenty of bread: but he that foUoweth after vain persons shall have poverty enough.
\p
\v 20 A faithful man shall abound with blessings: but he that maketh haste to be rich shall not be innocent.
\p
\v 21 To have respect of persons is not good: for for a piece of bread that man will transgress.
\p
\v 22 He that hasteth to be rich hath an evil eye, and considereth not that poverty shall come upon him.
\p
\v 23 He that rebuketh a man afterwards shall find more favour than he that flattereth with the tongue.
\p
\v 24 Whoso i’robbeth his father or his mother, and saith, It is no transgression; the same is the companion of a destroyer.
\p
\v 25 He that is of a proud heart stirreth up strife: but he that putteth his trust in the LORD shall be made fat.
\p
\v 26 He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool: but whoso walketh wisely, he shall be delivered.
\p
\v 27 He that giveth unto the poor shall not lack: but he that hideth his eyes shall have many a ■curse.
\p
\v 28 When the wicked rise, men hide themselves: but when they perish, the righteous increase.
\c 29
\cl CHAPTER 29
\p
\v 1 HE, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
\p
\v 2 When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice: but when the wicked beareth rule, the people mourn.
\p
\v 3 Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father: but he that keepeth company with harlots spendeth his substance.
\p
\v 4 The king by judgment establisheth the land: but he that receiveth gifts overthroweth it.
\p
\v 5 A man that s’fiattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.
\p
\v 6 In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare: but the righteous doth sing and rejoice.
\p
\v 7 The righteous considereth the cause of the poor: but the wicked regardeth not to know it.
\p
\v 8 Scornful men bring a city into a flame: but wise men turn away wrath.
\p
\v 9 If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.
\p
\v 10 The bloodthirsty hate the upright: but the just seek his soul.
\p
\v 11 A fool uttereth all his mind: but a wise man keepeth it in till afterwards.
\p
\v 12 If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.
\p
\v 13 The poor and the deceitful man meet together: the Lord enlighteneth both their eyes.
\p
\v 14 The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
\p
\v 15 The rod and reproof give wisdom: but a child left to himself bringeth his mother to shame.
\p
\v 16 When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth: but the righteous shall see their fall.
\p
\v 17 Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
\p
\v 18 Where there is no vision, the people perish: but he that keepeth the law, happy is he.
\p
\v 19 A servant will not be corrected by words: for though he understand he will not answer.
\p
\v 20 Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
\p
\v 21 He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become as his son at the length.
\p
\v 22 An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
\p
\v 23 The pride of a man will humiliate him; but the humble in spirit shall attain honour.
\p
\v 24 Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul: he heareth the adjuration and dareth not to tell.
\p
\v 25 The fear of man bringeth a snare: but whoso putteth his trust in the Lord shall be safe.
\p
\v 26 Many seek the ruler’s favour; but every man’s judgment cometh from the Lord.
\p
\v 27 An unjust man is an abomination to the just: and he that is upright in the way is abomination to the wicked.

\cl CHAPTER 30
\p
\v 1 THE words of Agur the son of Jakeh, even the prophecy: the man spake unto Ithiel, even unto Ithiel and Ucal,
\p
\v 2 Surely I am more brutish than any man, and have not the understanding of a man.
\p
\v 3 I neither learned wisdom, nor have the knowledge of the Holy one.
\p
\v 4 Who hath ascended up into heaven, and come down again? who hath gathered the wind in his fists? who hath bound the waters in a garment? who hath established all the ends of the earth? what is his name, and what is his son’s name, if thou canst tell ?
\p
\v 5 Every word of God is pure: he is a shield unto them that put their trust in him.
\p
\v 6 Add thou not unto his words, lest he reprove thee, and thou be found a liar.
\p
\v 7 Two things have I required of thee; deny me them not before I die:
\p
\v 8 Remove far from me vanity and lies: give me neither poverty nor riches; let me m% the bread appointed unto me:
\p
\v 9 Lest I be full, and deny thee, and say, Who is the Lord? or lest I be poor, and steal, and take the name of my God in vain.
\p
\v 10 Accuse not a servant unto his master, lest he curse thee, and thou be found guilty.
\p
\v 11 There is a generation that curs-eth their father, and doth not bless their mother.
\p
\v 12 There is a generation that are pure in there own eyes, and yet is not washed from their filthiness.
\p
\v 13 There is a generation, O how lofty are their eyes I and their eyelids are lifted up.
\p
\v 14 There is a generation, whose teeth are as swords, and their jaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men.
\p
\v 15 The horseleach hath two daughters, crying, Give, give. There are three things that are never satisfied, yea, four things say not. It is enough:
\p
\v 16 iThe %rave; and the barren womb; the earth that is not filled with water; and the fire that saith not, It is enough.
\p
\v 17 The eye that mocketh at his father, and despiseth to obey his mother, the havens of the valley shall pick it out, and the young eagles shall eat it.
\p
\v 18 There be three things which are too wonderful for me, yea, four which I know not:
\p
\v 19 The way of an eagle in the air; the way of a serpent upon a rock; the way of a ship in the midst of the sea; and the way of a man with a maid.
\p
\v 20 Such is the way of an adulterous woman; she eateth, and wipeth her mouth, and saith, I have done no wickedness.
\p
\v 81 For three things the earth is disquieted, and for four which it cannot bear:
\p
\v 23 For a servant when he reigneth; and a fool when he is filled with meat;
\p
\v 23 For an odious woman when she is married; and an handmaid that is heir to her mistress.
\p
\v 24 There be four things which are little upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise:
\p
\v 85 The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their meat in the summer;
\p
\v 26 The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses in the rocks;
\p
\v 27 The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by bands;
\p
\v 28 The spider thou canst catch with thy hands, and yet she is in kings' palaces.
\p
\v 29 There are three that have a stately step, yea, four go in a stately way:
\p
\v 30 A lion which is strongest among beasts, and turneth not away for any;
\p
\v 31 A greyhound; an he goat also; and a king, against whom there is no rising up.
\p
\v 32 If thou hast done foolishly in lifting up thyself, or if thou hast thought evil, lay thine hand upon thy niouth.
\p
\v 33 Surely the churning of milk bringeth forth butter, and the wringing of the nose bringeth forth blood: so the forcing of wrath bringeth forth strife,

\v 1 THE words of king Lemuel, the prophecy that his mother taught hirn.
\p
\v 2 What, my son? and what, the son of my womb? and what, the son of my vows ?
\p
\v 3 Give not thy strength vmto women, nor thy ways to that which destroyeth kings,
\p
\v 4 is not for kings, O Lemuel, it is not for kings to drink wine; nor for princes strong drink:
\p
\v 5 Lest they drink, and forget the law, and pervert the judgment of any of the afflicted.
\p
\v 6 Give strong drink unto him that is ready to perish, and wine unto those that be of heavy hearts.
\p
\v 7 Let him drink, and forget his poverty, and remember his misery no more.
\p
\v 8 Open thy mouth for the dumb in the cause of all such as are appointed to destruction*
\p
\v 9 Open thy mouth, judge righteously, and plead the cause of the poor and needy.
\p
\v 10 Who can find a virtuous woman? for her price is far above rubies.
\p
\v 11 The heart of her husband doth safely trust in her, and he will not see his store grow less.
\p
\v 12 She will do him good and not evil all the days of her life.
\p
\v 13 She seeketh wool, and flax, and worketh willingly with her hands.
\p
\v 14 She is like the merchants' ships; she bringeth her food from afar.
\p
\v 15 She riseth also while it is yet night, and giveth food to her household, and a task to her maidens.
\p
\v 16 She considereth a field, and buyeth it: with the fruit of her hands she planteth a vineard.
\p
\v 17 She .girdeth her loins with strength, and Strengtheneth her arms.
\p
\v 18 She perceiveth that her Merchandise is good: her candle goeth not out by night.
\p
\v 19 She layeth her hands to the spindle, and her hands hold the distaff.
\p
\v 20 She stretcheth out her hand to the poor; yea, she reacheth forth her hands to the needy.
\p
\v 21 She is not afraid of the snow for her household: for all her household are clothed with scarlet.
\p
\v 22 She maketh herself coverings of tapestry; with linen and purple is she clothed.
\p
\v 23 Her husband is known in the gates, when he sittetli among the elders of the land.
\p
\v 24 She maketh fine linen, and selleth it; and delivereth girdles unto the merchant*
\p
\v 25 Strength and honour are her clothing; and she shall rejoice in time to come.
\p
\v 26 She openeth her mouth with wisdom; and in her tongue is the law of kindness.
\p
\v 27 She looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of idleness.
\p
\v 28 Her children arise up, and call her blessed; her husband also sayeth in her praise,
\p
\v 29 Many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.
\p
\v 30 Favour is deceitful, and beauty is vain: but a woman that feareth the Lord, she shall be praised.
\p
\v 31 Give her of the fruit of her hands; and let her own Works praise her in the gates.
