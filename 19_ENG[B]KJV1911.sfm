\cl PSALM 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ Blessed \add is\add* the man that walketh not in the counsel of the ungodly, nor standeth in the way of sinners, nor sitteth in the seat of the scornful.
\p
\v 2 But his delight \add is\add* in the law of the LORD; and in his law doth he meditate day and night.
\p
\v 3 And he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth forth its fruit in its season; his leaf also shall not wither; and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.
\p
\v 4 The ungodly \add are\add* not so: but \add are\add* like the chaff which the wind driveth away.
\p
\v 5 Therefore the ungodly shall not stand in the judgment, nor sinners in the congregation of the righteous.
\p
\v 6 For the LORD knoweth the way of the righteous: but the way of the ungodly shall perish.
\c 2
\cl PSALM 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ Why do the nations rage, and the peoples imagine a vain thing?
\p
\v 2 The kings of the earth set themselves, and the rulers take counsel together, against the LORD, and against his anointed, \add saying,\add*
\p
\v 3 Let us break their bands asunder, and cast away their cords from us.
\p
\v 4 He that sitteth in the heavens shall laugh: the Lord shall have them in derision.
\p
\v 5 Then shall he speak unto them in his wrath, and vex them in his sore displeasure.
\p
\v 6 Yet have I set my king upon my holy hill of Zion.
\p
\v 7 I will declare the decree: the LORD hath said unto me, Thou \add art\add* my Son; this day have I begotten thee.
\p
\v 8 Ask of me, and I shall give \add thee\add* the nations \add for\add* thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth \add for\add* thy possession.
\p
\v 9 Thou shalt break them with a rod of iron; thou shalt dash them in pieces like a potter’s vessel.
\p
\v 10 Be wise now therefore, O ye kings: be instructed, ye judges of the earth.
\p
\v 11 Serve the LORD with fear, and rejoice with trembling.
\p
\v 12 Kiss the Son, lest he be angry, and ye perish \add from\add* the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little. Blessed \add are\add* all they that put their trust in him.
\c 3
\cl PSALM 3
\d A Psalm of David, when he fled from Absalom his son.
\p
\v 1 ¶ LORD, how are they increased that trouble me! many \add are\add* they that rise up against me.
\p
\v 2 Many \add there be\add* that say of my soul, \add There is\add* no help for him in God. Selah.
\p
\v 3 But thou, O LORD, \add art\add* a shield for me; my glory, and the lifter up of mine head.
\p
\v 4 I cried unto the LORD with my voice, and he heard me out of his holy hill. Selah.
\p
\v 5 I laid me down and slept; I awaked; for the LORD sustained me.
\p
\v 6 I will not be afraid of ten thousands of people, that have set \add themselves\add* against me round about.
\p
\v 7 Arise, O LORD; save me, O my God: for thou hast smitten all mine enemies \add upon\add* the cheek bone; thou hast broken the teeth of the ungodly.
\p
\v 8 Salvation \add belongeth\add* unto the LORD: thy blessing \add is\add* upon thy people. Selah.
\c 4
\cl PSALM 4
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ Hear me when I call, O God of my righteousness: thou hast enlarged me \add when I was\add* in distress; have mercy upon me, and hear my prayer.
\p
\v 2 O ye sons of men, how long \add will ye turn\add* my glory into shame? \add how long\add* will ye love vanity, \add and\add* seek after lies? Selah.
\p
\v 3 But know that the LORD hath set apart him that is godly for himself: the LORD will hear when I call unto him.
\p
\v 4 Stand in awe, and sin not: commune with your own heart upon your bed, and be still. Selah.
\p
\v 5 Offer the sacrifices of righteousness, and put your trust in the LORD.
\p
\v 6 \add There be\add* many that say, Who will show us \add any\add* good? LORD, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us.
\p
\v 7 Thou hast put gladness in my heart, more than in the time \add that\add* their corn and their wine increased.
\p
\v 8 I will both lay me down in peace, and sleep: for thou, LORD, only makest me dwell in safety.
\c 5
\cl PSALM 5
\d To the chief Musician upon Nehiloth, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
\p
\v 2 Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God: for unto thee will I pray.
\p
\v 3 My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct \add my prayer\add* unto thee, and will look up.
\p
\v 4 For thou \add art\add* not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness: neither shall evil dwell with thee.
\p
\v 5 The foolish shall not stand in thy sight: thou hatest all workers of iniquity.
\p
\v 6 Thou shalt destroy them that speak lies: the LORD will abhor the bloody and deceitful man.
\p
\v 7 But as for me, I will come \add into\add* thy house in the multitude of thy mercy: \add and\add* in thy fear will I worship toward thy holy temple.
\p
\v 8 Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
\p
\v 9 For \add there is\add* no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part \add is\add* very wickedness; their throat \add is\add* an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
\p
\v 10 Hold them not guiltless, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
\p
\v 11 But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice: let them ever shout for joy, because thou defendest them: let them also that love thy name be joyful in thee.
\p
\v 12 For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as \add with\add* a shield.

\cl PSALM 6
\d To the chief Musician on Neginoth upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ O LORD, rebuke me not in thine anger, neither chasten me in thy hot displeasure.
\p
\v 2 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; for I \add am\add* weak: O LORD, heal me; for my bones are vexed.
\p
\v 3 My soul is also sore vexed: but thou, O LORD, how long?
\p
\v 4 Return, O LORD, deliver my soul: oh save me for thy mercies’ sake.
\p
\v 5 For in death \add there is\add* no remembrance of thee: in the grave who shall give thee thanks?
\p
\v 6 I am weary with my groaning; all the night make I my bed to swim; I water my couch with my tears.
\p
\v 7 Mine eye is consumed because of grief; it waxeth old because of all mine enemies.
\p
\v 8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; for the LORD hath heard the voice of my weeping.
\p 
\v 9 The LORD hath heard my supplication; the LORD will receive my prayer.
\p 
\v 10 Let all mine enemies be ashamed and sore vexed: let them return \add and\add* be ashamed suddenly.
\c 7
\cl PSALM 7
\d Shiggaion of David, which he sang unto the LORD, concerning the words of Cush the Benjamite.
\p
\v 1 ¶ O Lord my God, in thee do I put my trust: save me from all them that persecute me, and deliver me:
\p
\v 2 Lest he tear my soul like a lion, rending \add it\add* in pieces, while \add there is\add* none to deliver.
\p
\v 3 O LORD my God, if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands;
\p 
\v 4 If I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; (yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy:)
\p
\v 5 Let the enemy persecute my soul, and take \add it;\add* yea, let him tread down my life upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust. Selah.
\p
\v 6 Arise, O LORD, in thine anger, lift up thyself because of the rage of mine enemies: and awake for me \add to\add* the judgment \add that\add* thou hast commanded.
\p
\v 7 So shall the congregation of the peoples compass thee about: for their sakes therefore return thou on high.
\p
\v 8 The LORD shall judge the peoples: judge me, O LORD, according to my righteousness, and according to mine integrity \add that is\add* in me.
\p
\v 9 Oh let the wickedness of the wicked come to an end; but establish the just: for the righteous God trieth the hearts and reins.
\p
\v 10 My defence \add is\add* of God, who saveth the upright in heart.
\p
\v 11 God judgeth the righteous, and God is angry \add with the wicked\add* every day.
\p
\v 12 If he turn not, he will whet his sword; he hath bent his bow, and made it ready.
\p
\v 13 He hath also prepared for him the instruments of death; he ordaineth his arrows against the persecutors.
\p
\v 14 Behold, he travaileth with iniquity, and hath conceived mischief, and brought forth falsehood.
\p
\v 15 He made a pit, and digged it, and is fallen into the ditch \add which\add* he made.
\p
\v 16 His mischief shall return upon his own head, and his violent dealing shall come down upon his own pate.
\p
\v 17 I will praise the LORD according to his righteousness: and will sing praise to the name of the LORD most high.
\c 8
\cl PSALM 8
\d To the chief Musician upon Gittith, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ O LORD our Lord, how excellent \add is\add* thy name in all the earth! who hast set thy glory above the heavens.
\p
\v 2 Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the enemy and the avenger.
\p
\v 3 When I consider thy heavens, the work of thy fingers, the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained;
\p
\v 4 What is man, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?
\p
\v 5 For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned him with glory and honour.
\p
\v 6 Thou madest him to have dominion over the works of thy hands; thou hast put all \add things\add* under his feet:
\p
\v 7 All sheep and oxen, yea, and the beasts of the field;
\p
\v 8 The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, \add and whatsoever\add* passeth through the paths of the seas.
\p
\v 9 O LORD our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!
\c 9
\cl PSALM 9
\d To the chief Musician upon Muthlabben, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ I will praise \add thee,\add* O LORD, with my whole heart; I will show forth all thy marvellous works.
\p
\v 2 I will be glad and rejoice in thee: I will sing praise to thy name, O thou most High.
\p
\v 3 When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
\p
\v 4 For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
\p
\v 5 Thou hast rebuked the nations, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
\p
\v 6 O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end: and thou hast destroyed cities; their memorial is perished with them.
\p
\v 7 But the LORD shall endure for ever: he hath prepared his throne for judgment.
\p
\v 8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the peoples in uprightness.
\p
\v 9 The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
\p
\v 10 And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee: for thou, LORD, hast not forsaken them that seek thee.
\p
\v 11 Sing praises to the LORD, who dwelleth in Zion: declare among the peoples his doings.
\p
\v 12 When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them: he forgetteth not the cry of the humble.
\p
\v 13 Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my affliction \add which I suffer\add* of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death:
\p
\v 14 That I may show forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion: I will rejoice in thy salvation.
\p
\v 15 The nations are sunk down in the pit \add that\add* they made: in the net which they hid is their own foot taken.
\p
\v 16 The LORD is known \add by\add* the judgment \add which\add* he executeth: the wicked is snared in the work of his own hands. Higgaion. Selah.
\p
\v 17 The wicked shall be turned into hell, \add and\add* all the nations that forget God.
\p
\v 18 For the needy shall not alway be forgotten: the expectation of the poor shall \add not\add* perish for ever.
\p
\v 19 Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail: let the nations be judged in thy sight.
\p
\v 20 Put them in fear, O LORD: \add that\add* the nations may know themselves \add to be but\add* men. Selah.

\cl PSALM 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? \add why\add* hidest thou \add thyself\add* in times of trouble?
\p
\v 2 The wicked in \add his\add* pride doth persecute the poor: let them be taken in the devices that they have imagined.
\p
\v 3 For the wicked boasteth of his heart’s desire, and blesseth the covetous, \add whom\add* the LORD abhorreth.
\p
\v 4 The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek \add after God:\add* God \add is\add* not in all his thoughts.
\p
\v 5 His ways are always grievous; thy judgments \add are\add* far above out of his sight: \add as for\add* all his enemies, he puffeth at them.
\p
\v 6 He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved: for \add I shall\add* never \add be\add* in adversity.
\p
\v 7 His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud: under his tongue \add is\add* mischief and vanity.
\p
\v 8 He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages: in the secret places doth he murder the innocent: his eyes are privily set against the poor.
\p
\v 9 He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den: he lieth in wait to catch the poor: he doth catch the poor, when he draweth him into his net.
\p
\v 10 He croucheth, \add and\add* humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
\p
\v 11 He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten: he hideth his face; he will never see \add it.\add*
\p
\v 12 Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand: forget not the humble.
\p
\v 13 Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require \add it.\add*
\p
\v 14 Thou hast seen \add it;\add* for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite \add it\add* with thy hand: the poor committeth himself unto thee; thou hast been the helper of the fatherless.
\p 
\v 15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil \add man:\add* seek out his wickedness \add till\add* thou find none.
\p
\v 16 The LORD \add is\add* King for ever and ever: the nations are perished out of his land.
\p
\v 17 LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble: thou wilt prepare their heart, thou wilt cause thine ear to hear:
\p
\v 18 To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.

\d To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ In the LORD put I my trust: how say ye to my soul, Flee \add as\add* a bird to your mountain?
\p
\v 2 For, lo, the wicked bend \add their\add* bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
\p
\v 3 If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
\p
\v 4 The LORD \add is\add* in his holy temple, the LORD’S throne \add is\add* in heaven: his eyes behold, his eyelids try, the children of men.
\p
\v 5 The LORD trieth the righteous: but the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth.
\p
\v 6 Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest: \add this shall be\add* the portion of their cup.
\p
\v 7 For righteous is the LORD, he loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.

\cl PSALM 12
\d To the chief Musician upon Sheminith, A Psalm of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ Help, LORD; for the godly man ceaseth; for the faithful fail from among the children of men.
\p
\v 2 They speak vanity every one with his neighbour: \add with\add* flattering lips \add and\add* with a double heart do they speak.
\p
\v 3 The LORD shall cut off all flattering lips, \add and\add* the tongue that speaketh proud things:
\p
\v 4 Who have said, With our tongue will we prevail; our lips \add are\add* our own: who \add is\add* lord over us?
\p 
\v 5 For the oppression of the poor, for the sighing of the needy, now will I arise, saith the LORD; I will set \add him\add* in safety \add from him that\add* puffeth at him.
\p
\v 6 The words of the LORD \add are\add* pure words: \add as\add* silver tried in a furnace of earth, purified seven times.
\p
\v 7 Thou shalt keep them, O LORD, thou shalt preserve them from this generation for ever.

\v 2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul, \add having\add* sorrow in my heart daily? how long shall mine enemy be exalted over me?
\p
\v 3 Consider \add and\add* answer me, O LORD my God: lighten mine eyes, lest I sleep the \add sleep of\add* death;
\p
\v 4 Lest mine enemy say, I have prevailed against him; \add and\add* those that trouble me rejoice when I am moved.
\p
\v 5 But I have trusted in thy mercy; my heart shall rejoice in thy salvation.

\d To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David.
\p
\v 1 ¶ The fool hath said in his heart, \add There is\add* no God. They are corrupt, they have done abominable works, \add there is\add* none that doeth good.
\p
\v 2 The LORD looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, \add and\add* seek God.
\p
\v 3 They are all gone aside, they are \add all\add* together become filthy: \add there is\add* none that doeth good, no, not one.
\p
\v 4 Have all the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people \add as\add* they eat bread, and call not upon the LORD.
\p
\v 5 There were they in great fear: for God \add is\add* in the generation of the righteous.
\p
\v 6 Ye have shamed the counsel of the poor, because the LORD \add is\add* his refuge.
\p
\v 7 Oh that the salvation of Israel \add were come\add* out of Zion! when the LORD bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, \add and\add* Israel shall be glad.

\v 7 Show thy marvellous lovingkindness, O thou that savest by thy right hand them that put their trust \add in thee\add* from those that rise up \add against them.\add*
\p
\v 8 Keep me as the apple of the eye, hide me under the shadow of thy wings,

\cl PSALM 18
\d To the chief Musician, \add A Psalm\add* of David, the servant of the LORD, who spake unto the LORD the words of this song in the day \add that\add* the LORD delivered him from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul: And he said,
\p
\v 1 ¶ I will love thee, O Lord, my strength.
\p
\v 2 The LORD \add is\add* my rock, and my fortress, and my deliverer; my God, my strength, in whom I will trust; my buckler, and the horn of my salvation, \add and\add* my high tower.
\p
\v 3 I will call upon the LORD, \add who is worthy\add* to be praised: so shall I be saved from mine enemies.
\p
\v 4 The sorrows of death compassed me, and the floods of ungodly men made me afraid.
\p
\v 5 The sorrows of hell compassed me about: the snares of death seized on me.
\p
\v 6 In my distress I called upon the LORD, and cried unto my God: he heard my voice out of his temple, and my cry came before him, \add even\add* into his ears.
\p
\v 7 Then the earth shook and trembled; the foundations also of the hills moved and were shaken, because he was wroth.
\p
\v 8 There went up a smoke out of his nostrils, and fire out of his mouth devoured: coals were kindled by it.
\p
\v 9 He bowed the heavens also, and came down: and thick darkness \add was\add* under his feet.
\p
\v 10 And he rode upon a cherub, and did fly: yea, he did fly upon the wings of the wind.
\p
\v 11 He made darkness his hiding place; his pavilion round about him \add were\add* dark waters \add and\add* thick clouds of the skies.
\p
\v 12 At the brightness \add that was\add* before him his thick clouds passed, hail \add stones\add* and coals of fire.
\p
\v 13 The LORD also thundered in the heavens, and the Highest gave his voice; hail \add stones\add* and coals of fire.
\p
\v 14 Yea, he sent out his arrows, and scattered them; and he shot out lightnings, and discomfited them.
\p
\v 15 Then the channels of waters were seen, and the foundations of the world were discovered at thy rebuke, O LORD, at the blast of the breath of thy nostrils.
\p
\v 16 He sent from above, he took me, he drew me out of many waters.
\p
\v 17 He delivered me from my strong enemy, and from them that hated me: for they were too strong for me.
\p
\v 18 They overcame me in the day of my calamity: but the LORD was my stay.
\p
\v 19 He brought me forth also into a large place; he delivered me, because he delighted in me.
\p
\v 20 The LORD rewarded me according to my righteousness; according to the cleanness of my hands hath he recompensed me.
\p
\v 21 For I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not wickedly departed from my God.
\p
\v 22 For all his judgments \add were\add* before me, and I did not put away his statutes from me.
\p
\v 23 I was also upright before him, and I kept myself from mine iniquity.
\p
\v 24 Therefore hath the LORD recompensed me according to my righteousness, according to the cleanness of my hands in his eyesight.
\p

\p
\v 2 For he fiattereth himself in his own eyes, until his iniquity be found to be hateful.
\p
\v 3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit: he hath left off to be wise, and to do good.
\p
\v 4 He deviseth mischief upon his bed; he setteth himself in a way that is not good; he abhorreth not evil.
\p
\v 5 Thy mercy, O Lord, is in the heavens; and thy faithfulness reacheth unto the clouds.
\p
\v 6 Thy righteousness is like the great mountains; thy judgments are a great deep: O LORD, thou preservest man and beast.

\p
\v 8 They shall be abundantly .fsatisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.

\v 6 Let not them that wait on thee, O Lord God of hosts, be ashamed for my sake: let not those that seek thee be confounded for my sake, O God of Israel.

\p
\v 3 I remembered God, and was troubled: I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed. Selah.

\v 4 Thou holdest mine eyes waking: I am so troubled that I cannot speak.

\d Maschil of Asaph.
\p
\v 1 GIVE ear, O my people, to my law: incline your ears to the words of my mouth.
\p
\v 3 I will open my mouth in a parable: I will utter dark sayings of old:
\p
\v 3 Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us.
\p
\v 4 We will not hide them from their children, showing to the generation to come the praises of the Lord, and his strength, and his wonderful works that he hath done.
\p
\v 5 For he established a testimony in Jacob, and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers, that they should make them known to their children:
\p
\v 6 That the generation to come might know them, even the children that should be bom; who should arise and declare them to their children:
\p
\v 7 That they might set their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments:
\p
\v 8 And might not be as their fathers, a stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their heart aright, and whose spirit was not stedfast with God.
\p
\v 9 The children of Ephraim, bein armed, and carrying bows, turned back in the day of battle.
\p
\v 10 They kept not the covenant of God, and refused to walk in his
\p
\v 6 law;
\p
\v 11 And forgat his works, and his wonders that he had showed them.
\p
\v 12 Marvellous things did he in the sight of their fathers, in the land of Egypt, in the field ofjZoan.
\p
\v 13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through; and he made the waters to stand as an heap.
\p
\v 14 In the daytime also he led them with a cloud, and all the night with a light of fire.
\p
\v 15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, and gave them drink as out of the great depths.
\p
\v 16 He brought streams also out of the rock, and caused waters to run down like rivers.
\p
\v 17 And they sinned yet more against him by provoking the most High in the wilderness.
\p
\v 18 And they tempted God in their heart by asking meat for their lust.
\p
\v 19 Yea, they spake against God; they said, Can God furnish a table in the wilderness ?
\p
\v 20 Behold, he smote the rock, that the waters gushed out, and the streams overflowed; can he give thread also? can he provide flesh for his people ?
\p
\v 21 Therefore the LORD heard this, and was wroth: so a fire was kindled against Jacob, and anger also came up against Israel;
\p
\v 22 Because they believed not in God, and trusted not in his salvation:
\p
\v 23 Though he had commanded the clouds from above, and opened the • doors of heaven,
\p
\v 24 And had rained down manna upon them to eat, and had given them of the corn of heaven.
\p
\v 25 Man did eat angels' food: he sent them meat to the full.
\p
\v 26 He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven: and by his power he brought in the south wind.
\p
\v 27 He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and feathered fowls like as the sand of the sea:
\p
\v 28 And he let it fall in the midst of their camp, round about their habitations.
\p
\v 29 So they did eat, and were well filled: for he gave them their own desire;
\p
\v 30 They were not estranged from their •lust. But while their meat was yet in their mouths,
\p
\v 31 The wrath of God came upon them, and slew the fattest of them, and smote down the chosen men of Israel.
\p
\v 32 For all this they sinned still, and believed not for his wondrous works.
\p
\v 33 Therefore their days did he consume in vanity, and their years in trouble.
\p
\v 34 When he slew them, then they sought him: and they returned and inquired early after God.
\p
\v 35 And they remembered that God was their rock, and the high God their redeemer.
\p
\v 36 Nevertheless they did flatter him with their mouth, and they lied unto him with their tongues.
\p
\v 37 For their heart was not right with him, neither were they stedfast in his covenant.
\p
\v 38 But he, being full of .Jcompassion, forgave lei’r iniquity, and destroyed them not: yea, many a time turned he his anger away, and did not stir up all his wrath.
\p
\v 39 For he remembered that they were but flesh; a wind that passeth away, and cometh not again.
\p
\v 40 How oft did they provoke him in the wilderness, and grieve him in the desert !
\p
\v 41 Yea, they turned back and tempted God, and limited the Holy One of Israel.
\p
\v 42 They remembered not his hand, nor the day when he delivered them from the enemy.
\p
\v 43 How he had wrought his signs in Egypt, and his wonders in the field of Zoan:
\p
\v 44 And had turned their rivers into blood; and their floods, that they could not drink.
\p
\v 45 He sent divers sorts of flies among them, which devoured them; and frogs, which destroyed them.
\p
\v 46 He gave also their increase unto the caterpillar, and their labour unto the locust.
\p
\v 47 He destroyed their vines with ■'hail, and their sycamore trees with frost. »
\p
\v 48 He gave up their cattle also to the hail, and their flocks to hot thunderbolts.
\p
\v 49 He cast upon them the fierceness of his anger, wrath, and indignation, and trouble, by sending evil angels among them.
\p
\v 50 He made a way to his anger; he spared not their soul from death, but gave their life over to the pestilence;
\p
\v 51 And smote all the firstborn in Egypt; the chief of ze r strength in the tabernacles of Ham:
\p
\v 52 But made his own people to go forth like sheep, and guided them in the wilderness like a flock.
\p
\v 53 And he led them on safely, so that they feared not: but the sea overwhelmed their enemies.
\p
\v 54 And he brought them to the border of his sanctuary, even to this mountain, which his right hand had purchased.
\p
\v 55 He cast out the nations also before them, and divided them an inheritance by line, and made the tribes of Israel to dwell in their tents.
\p
\v 56 Yet they tempted and provoked the most high God, and kept not his testimonies:
\p
\v 57 But turned back, and dealt unfaithfully like their fathers: they were turned aside like a deceitful bow.
\p
\v 58 For they provoked him to anger with their high places, and moved him to jealousy Vv4th their graven images.
\p
\v 59 When God heard this, he was wroth, and greatly abhorred Israel:
\p
\v 60 So that he forsook the itabernacle of Shiloh, the tent which he placed among men;
\p
\v 61 And delivered his strength into captivity, and his glory into the enemy’s hand.
\p
\v 62 He gave his people over also unto the sword; and was wroth with his inheritance.
\p
\v 63 The fire consumed their young men; and their maidens were not given to marriage.
\p
\v 64 Their priests fell by the sword; and their widows made no lamentation.
\p
\v 65 Then the Lord awaked as one out of sleep, and like a mighty man that shouteth by reason of wine.
\p
\v 66 And he smote his enemies in the hinder parts: he put them to a perpetual reproach.
\p
\v 67 Moreover he refused the tabernacle of Joseph, and chose not the tribe of Ephraim:
\p
\v 68 But chose the tribe of Judah, the mount Zion which he loved.
\p
\v 69 And he built his sanctuary like high palaces, like the earth which he hath established for ever.
\p
\v 70 He chose David also his servant, and took him from the sheepfolds:
\p
\v 71 From following the ewes great with young he brought him to feed JJacob his people, and Israel his inheritance.
\p
\v 72 So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart; and guided them by the skilfulness of his hands.

\p
\v 2 Let my prayer come before thee: incline thine ear unto my cry;
\p
\v 3 For my soul is full of troubles: and my life draweth nigh unto the grave.
\p
\v 4 I am counted with them that go down into the pit: I am as a man that hath no strength:

\v 5 Free among the dead, like the slain that lie in the grave, whom thou rememberest no more: and they are cut off from thy hand.

\v 6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, in darkness, in the deeps.

\v 7 Thy wrath lieth hard upon me, and thou hast afflicted me with all thy waves. Selah.

\v 9 Mine eye mourneth by reason of affliction: LORD, I have called daily upon thee, I have stretched out my hands unto thee.
\p
\v 10 Wilt thou show wonders to the dead? shall the dead arise and praise thee ? Selah.

\v 11 Shall thy lovingkindness be declared in the grave? or thy faithfulness in destruction ?

\v 2 Bless the LORD, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits:
\p
\v 3 Who forgiveth all thine iniquities; who heaieth all thy diseases;
\p
\v 4 Who redeemeth thy life from destruction; who crowneth thee with lovingkindness and tender mercies;
\p
\v 5 Who satisfieth thy mouth with good things; so that thy cyouth is renewed like the eagle’s.
\p
\v 6 The Lord executeth righteousness and judgment for all that are oppressed.
\p
\v 7 He made known his ways unto « Moses, his acts unto the children of Israel.
\p
\v 8 The Lord is merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and plenteous in mercy.
\p
\v 9 He will not always chide: neither will he keep his anger for ever.
\p
\v 10 He hath not dealt with us after our sins; nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
\p
\v 11 For as the heaven is high above the earth, so great is his mercy toward them that fear him.
\p
\v 12 As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.
\p
\v 13 Like as a father pitieth his children, so the LORD pitieth them that fear him.

\p
\v 3 Who layeth the beams of his chambers in the waters: whomaketh the clouds his chariot: who walketh upon the wings of the wind:
\p
\v 4 Who maketh his angels spirits; his ministers a flaming fire:
\p
\v 5 Who laid the foundations of the earth, that it should not be removed for ever.
\p
\v 6 Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood above the mountains.
\p
\v 7 At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder they hasted away.
\p
\v 8 They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys unto the place which thou hast founded for them.
\p
\v 9 Thou hast set a bound that they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.
\p
\v 10 He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.
\p
\v 11 They give drink to every beast of the field: the wild asses quench their thirst.
\p
\v 12 By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which sing among the branches.
\p
\v 13 He watereth the hills from his chambers: the earth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.
\p
\v 14 He causeth the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of man: that he may bring forth food out of the earth;
\p
\v 15 And wine that maketh glad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to -'shine, and bread which strengtheneth man’s heart.
\p
\v 16 The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he hath planted;
\p
\v 17 Where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir trees are her house.
\p
\v 18 The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats; and the rocks for the conies.
\p

\p

\p
\v 26 There go the ships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein.
\p

\p
\v 28 That thou givest them they gather: thou openest thine hand, they are filled with good.
\p
\v 29 Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled: thou takest away their breath, they die, and return to their dust.
\p
\v 30 Thou sendest forth thy spirit, they are created: and thou renewest the face of the earth.
\p
\v 31 The glory of the Lord shall endure for ever: the LORD shall rejoice in his works.

\v 7 He is the Lord our God: his judgments are in all the earth.
\p
\v 8 He hath remembered his covenant for ever, the vvrord which he commanded to a thousand generations.
\p
\v 9 Which covenant he made with Abraham, and his oath unto Isaac;
\p
\v 10 And confirmed the same unto Jacob for a law, and to Israel or an everlasting covenant:
\p
\v 11 Saying, Unto thee will I give the land of Canaan, the lot of your inheritance:
\p
\v 12 When they were but a few men in number; yea, very few, and strangers in it.
\p
\v 13 When they went from one nation to another, from one kingdom to another people;
\p
\v 14 He suffered no man to do them wrong: yea, he reproved kings for their sakes;
\p
\v 15 Saying, Touch not mine anointed, and do my prophets no harm.
\p
\v 16 Moreover he called for a famine upon the land: he brake the whole staff of bread.
\p
\v 17 He sent a man before them, even Joseph, who was sold for a servant:
\p 
\v 18 Whose feet they hurt with fetters: he was laid in iron:
\p
\v 19 Until the time that his word came: the word of the LORD tried him.
\p
\v 20 The king sent and loosed him; even the ruler of the peoples, and let him go free.
\p
\v 21 He made him lord of his house, and ruler of all his substance:
\p
\v 22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; and teach his senators wisdom.
\p
\v 23 Israel also came into Egypt; and Jacob sojourned in the lancf of Ham.
\p
\v 24 And he increased his people greatly; and made them stronger than their enemies.
\p
\v 25 He turned their heart to hate his people, to deal subtly with his servants.
\p
\v 26 He sent Moses his servant; and Aaron whom he had chosen.
\p
\v 27 They showed his signs among them, and wonders in the land of Ham.
\p
\v 28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; and they rebelled not against his word.
\p
\v 29 He turned their waters into blood, and slew their fish.
\p
\v 30 Their land brought forth frogs in abundance, in the chambers of their kings.
\p
\v 31 He spake, and there came divers sorts of flies, and *'lice in all their coasts.
\p
\v 32 He gave them hail for rain, and flaming fire in their land.
\p
\v 33 He smote their vines also and their J fig trees; and brake the trees of their coasts.

\p

\p
\v 6 We have sinned with our fathers, we have committed iniquity, we have done vickediy.
\p
\v 7 Our fathers understood not thy wonders in Egypt; they remembered not the multitude of thy mercies; but provoked him at the sea, even at the i’Red Sea.
\p
\v 8 Nevertheless he saved them for his name’s sake, that he might make his mighty power to be known.
\p
\v 9 He rebuked the Red Sea also, and it was dried up: so he led them through the depths, as through the wilderness.
\p
\v 10 And he saved them from the hand of him that hated them, and redeemed them from the hand of the enemy.
\p
\v 11 And the waters covered their enemies: there was not one of them left.
\p
\v 12 Then believed they his words; they sang his praise.
\p
\v 13 They soon forgat his works; they waited not for his counsel:
\p
\v 14 But lusted. exceedingly in the wilderness, and Hempted God in the desert.
\p
\v 15 And he gave them their request; but sent leanness into their soul.
\p
\v 16 They envied * Moses also in the camp, and Aaron the saint of the Lord.
\p
\v 17 The earth opened and swallowed up Dathan, and covered the company of Abiram.
\p
\v 18 And a fire was kindled in their company; the flame burned up the wicked.
\p
\v 19 They made a calf in Horeb, and worshipped the molten image.
\p
\v 20 Thus they changed their glory into the similitude of an ox that eateth grass.
\p
\v 21 They forgat Gk)d their saviour, who had done great things in Egypt;
\p
\v 22 Wondrous works in the Hand of Ham, and terrible things by the Red Sea.
\p
\v 23 Therefore he said that he would destroy them, had not Moses his chosen stood before him in the breach, to turn away his wrath, lest he should destroy them.
\p
\v 24 Yea, they despised the pleasant land, they believed not his word:
\p
\v 25 But murmured in their tents, and hearkened not unto the voice of the Lord.
\p
\v 26 Therefore heflifted up his hand against them, to overthrow them in the wilderness:
\p
\v 27 To overthrow their seed also among the nations, and to scatter them in the lands.
\p
\v 28 They joined themselves also unto JBaal-peor, and ate the sacrifices of the dead.
\p
\v 29 Thus they provoked him to anger with their inventions: and the plague brake in upon them.
\p
\v 30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: and so the plague was stayed.
\p
\v 31 And that was counted unto him for righteousness unto all generations for evermore.
\p
\v 32 They angered him also at the waters of strife, so that it went ill with Moses for their sakes:
\p
\v 33 Because they provoked his spirit, so that he spake unadvisedly with his lips.
\p
\v 34 They did not destroy the nations, concerning whom the Lord commanded them:
\p
\v 35 But were mingled among the nations, and learned their works.
\p
\v 36 And they served their idols: which were a snare unto them.
\p
\v 37 Yea, they sacrificed their sons and their daughters unto demons,
\p
\v 38 And shed innocent blood, even the blood of their sons and of their daughters, whom they sacrificed unto the idols of Canaan: and the land was polluted with blood.
\p
\v 39 Thus were they defiled with their own works, and went a whoring with their own inventions.
\p
\v 40 Therefore was the wrath of the Lord kindled against his people, insomuch that he .abhorred his own inheritance.
\p
\v 41 And he gave them into the hand of the nations; and they that hated them ruled over them.
\p
\v 42 Their enemies also oppressed them, and they were brought into subjection under their hand.
\p
\v 43 Many times did he deliver them; but they provoked him with their counsel, and were brought low for their iniquity.
\p
\v 44 Nevertheless he regarded their affliction, when he heard their cry:
\p
\v 45 And he remem.bered for them his covenant, and repented according to the multitude of his mercies.
\p
\v 46 He made them also to be pitied of all those that carried them captives.
