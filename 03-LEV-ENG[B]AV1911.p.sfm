\p
\v 1 ¶ And the LORD called unto Moses, and spake unto him out of the tabernacle of the congregation, saying,
\p
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, If any man of you bring an offering unto the LORD, ye shall bring your offering of the cattle, \add even\add* of the herd, and of the flock.
\p
\v 3 If his offering \add be\add* a burnt sacrifice of the herd, let him offer a male without blemish: unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation shall he bring it, that it may be graciously received for him before the LORD.
\p
\v 4 And he shall put his hand upon the head of the burnt offering; and it shall be accepted for him to make atonement for him.
\p
\v 5 And he shall kill the bullock before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall bring the blood, and sprinkle the blood round about upon the altar that \add is by\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 6 And he shall flay the burnt offering, and cut it into its pieces.
\p
\v 7 And the sons of Aaron the priest shall put fire upon the altar, and lay the wood in order upon the fire:
\p
\v 8 And the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall lay the parts, the head, and the fat, in order upon the wood that \add is\add* on the fire which \add is\add* upon the altar:
\p
\v 9 But its inwards and its legs shall he wash in water: and the priest shall burn all on the altar, \add to be\add* a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And if his offering \add be\add* of the flocks, \add namely,\add* of the sheep, or of the goats, for a burnt sacrifice; he shall bring it a male without blemish.
\p
\v 11 And he shall kill it on the side of the altar northward before the LORD: and the priests, Aaron’s sons, shall sprinkle its blood round about upon the altar.
\p
\v 12 And he shall cut it into its pieces, with its head and its fat: and the priest shall lay them in order on the wood that \add is\add* on the fire which \add is\add* upon the altar:
\p
\v 13 But he shall wash the inwards and the legs with water: and the priest shall bring \add it\add* all, and burn \add it\add* upon the altar: it \add is\add* a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And if the burnt sacrifice for his offering to the LORD \add be\add* of fowls, then he shall bring his offering of turtledoves, or of young pigeons.
\p
\v 15 And the priest shall bring it unto the altar, and wring off its head, and burn \add it\add* on the altar; and the blood thereof shall be wrung out at the side of the altar:
\p
\v 16 And he shall pluck away its crop with its feathers, and cast it beside the altar on the east part, by the place of the ashes:
\p
\v 17 And he shall cleave it with the wings thereof, \add but\add* shall not divide \add it\add* asunder: and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, upon the wood that \add is\add* upon the fire: it \add is\add* a burnt sacrifice, an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.

\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when any will offer a meal offering unto the LORD, his offering shall be \add of\add* fine flour; and he shall pour oil upon it, and put frankincense thereon:
\p
\v 2 And he shall bring it to Aaron’s sons the priests: and he shall take thereout his handful of the flour thereof, and of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof; and the priest shall burn the memorial of it upon the altar, \add to be\add* an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD:
\p
\v 3 And the remnant of the meal offering \add shall be\add* Aaron’s and his sons’: \add it is\add* a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
\p
\v 4 ¶ And if thou bring an oblation of a meal offering baken in the oven, \add it shall be\add* unleavened cakes of fine flour mingled with oil, or unleavened wafers anointed with oil.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And if thy oblation \add be\add* a meal offering \add baken\add* in a pan, it shall be \add of\add* fine flour unleavened, mingled with oil.
\p
\v 6 Thou shalt part it in pieces, and pour oil thereon: it \add is\add* a meal offering.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And if thy oblation \add be\add* a meal offering \add baken\add* in the frying pan, it shall be made \add of\add* fine flour with oil.
\p
\v 8 And thou shalt bring the meal offering that is made of these things unto the LORD: and when it is presented unto the priest, he shall bring it unto the altar.
\p
\v 9 And the priest shall take from the meal offering a memorial thereof, and shall burn \add it\add* upon the altar: \add it is\add* an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 10 And that which is left of the meal offering \add shall be\add* Aaron’s and his sons’: \add it is\add* a thing most holy of the offerings of the LORD made by fire.
\p
\v 11 No meal offering, which ye shall bring unto the LORD, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the LORD made by fire.
\p
\v 12 ¶ As for the oblation of the firstfruits, ye shall offer them unto the LORD: but they shall not be burnt on the altar for a sweet savour.
\p
\v 13 And every oblation of thy meal offering shalt thou season with salt; neither shalt thou suffer the salt of the covenant of thy God to be lacking from thy meal offering: with all thine offerings thou shalt offer salt.
\p
\v 14 And if thou offer a meal offering of thy firstfruits unto the LORD, thou shalt offer for the meal offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn dried by the fire, \add even\add* corn beaten out of full ears.
\p
\v 15 And thou shalt put oil upon it, and lay frankincense thereon: it \add is\add* a meal offering.
\p
\v 16 And the priest shall burn the memorial of it, \add part\add* of the beaten corn thereof, and \add part\add* of the oil thereof, with all the frankincense thereof: \add it is\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD.

\p
\v 1 ¶ And if his oblation \add be\add* a sacrifice of peace offering, if he offer \add it\add* of the herd; whether \add it be\add* a male or female, he shall offer it without blemish before the LORD.
\p
\v 2 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons the priests shall sprinkle the blood upon the altar round about.
\p
\v 3 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that \add is\add* upon the inwards,
\p
\v 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* on them, which \add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
\p
\v 5 And Aaron’s sons shall burn it on the altar upon the burnt sacrifice, which \add is\add* upon the wood that \add is\add* on the fire: \add it is\add* an offering made by fire, of a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And if his offering for a sacrifice of peace offering unto the LORD \add be\add* of the flock; male or female, he shall offer it without blemish.
\p
\v 7 If he offer a lamb for his offering, then shall he offer it before the LORD.
\p
\v 8 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of his offering, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and Aaron’s sons shall sprinkle the blood thereof round about upon the altar.
\p
\v 9 And he shall offer of the sacrifice of the peace offering an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat thereof, \add and\add* the whole rump, it shall he take off hard by the backbone; and the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that \add is\add* upon the inwards,
\p
\v 10 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, which \add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
\p
\v 11 And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: \add it is\add* the food of the offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And if his offering \add be\add* a goat, then he shall offer it before the LORD.
\p
\v 13 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of it, and kill it before the tabernacle of the congregation: and the sons of Aaron shall sprinkle the blood thereof upon the altar round about.

\v 14 And he shall offer thereof his offering, \add even\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that \add is\add* upon the inwards,

\v 15 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, which \add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away.
\p
\v 16 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar: \add it is\add* the food of the offering made by fire for a sweet savour: all the fat \add is\add* the LORD’S.
\p
\v 17 \add It shall be\add* a perpetual statute for your generations throughout all your dwellings, that ye eat neither fat nor blood.

\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin through ignorance against any of the commandments of the LORD \add concerning things\add* which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them:
\p
\v 3 If the priest that is anointed do sin according to the sin of the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the LORD for a sin offering.
\p
\v 4 And he shall bring the bullock unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation before the LORD; and shall lay his hand upon the bullock’s head, and kill the bullock before the LORD.
\p
\v 5 And the priest that is anointed shall take of the bullock’s blood, and bring it to the tabernacle of the congregation:
\p
\v 6 And the priest shall dip his finger in the blood, and sprinkle of the blood seven times before the LORD, before the vail of the sanctuary.
\p
\v 7 And the priest shall put \add some\add* of the blood upon the horns of the altar of sweet incense before the LORD, which \add is\add* in the tabernacle of the congregation; and shall pour all the blood of the bullock at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which \add is at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 8 And he shall take off from it all the fat of the bullock for the sin offering; the fat that covereth the inwards, and all the fat that \add is\add* upon the inwards,
\p
\v 9 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* upon them, which \add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away,
\p
\v 10 As it was taken off from the bullock of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall burn them upon the altar of the burnt offering.
\p
\v 11 And the skin of the bullock, and all its flesh, with its head, and with its legs, and its inwards, and its dung,
\p
\v 12 Even the whole bullock shall he carry forth without the camp unto a clean place, where the ashes are poured out, and burn it on the wood with fire: where the ashes are poured out shall it be burnt.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And if the whole congregation of Israel sin through ignorance, and the thing be hid from the eyes of the assembly, and they have done \add somewhat against\add* any of the commandments of the LORD \add concerning things\add* which should not be done, and are guilty;
\p
\v 14 When the sin, which they have sinned against it, is known, then the congregation shall offer a young bullock for the sin offering, and bring it before the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 15 And the elders of the congregation shall lay their hands upon the head of the bullock before the LORD: and the bullock shall be killed before the LORD.
\p
\v 16 And the priest that is anointed shall bring of the bullock’s blood to the tabernacle of the congregation:
\p
\v 17 And the priest shall dip his finger \add in some\add* of the blood, and sprinkle \add it\add* seven times before the LORD, \add even\add* before the vail.
\p
\v 18 And he shall put \add some\add* of the blood upon the horns of the altar which \add is\add* before the LORD, that \add is\add* in the tabernacle of the congregation, and shall pour out all the blood at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering, which \add is at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 19 And he shall take all its fat from it, and burn \add it\add* upon the altar.
\p
\v 20 And he shall do with the bullock as he did with the bullock for a sin offering, so shall he do with this: and the priest shall make an atonement for them, and it shall be forgiven them.
\p
\v 21 And he shall carry forth the bullock without the camp, and burn it as he burned the first bullock: it \add is\add* a sin offering for the congregation.
\p
\v 22 ¶ When a ruler hath sinned, and done \add somewhat\add* through ignorance \add against\add* any of the commandments of the LORD his God \add concerning things\add* which should not be done, and is guilty;
\p
\v 23 Or if his sin, wherein he hath sinned, come to his knowledge; he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a male without blemish:
\p
\v 24 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the goat, and kill it in the place where they kill the burnt offering before the LORD: it \add is\add* a sin offering.
\p
\v 25 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out its blood at the bottom of the altar of burnt offering.
\p
\v 26 And he shall burn all its fat upon the altar, as the fat of the sacrifice of peace offerings: and the priest shall make an atonement for him as concerning his sin, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And if any one of the common people sin through ignorance, while he doeth \add somewhat against\add* any of the commandments of the LORD \add concerning things\add* which ought not to be done, and be guilty;
\p
\v 28 Or if his sin, which he hath sinned, come to his knowledge: then he shall bring his offering, a kid of the goats, a female without blemish, for his sin which he hath sinned.
\p
\v 29 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay the sin offering in the place of the burnt offering.
\p
\v 30 And the priest shall take of the blood thereof with his finger, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar.
\p
\v 31 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat is taken away from off the sacrifice of peace offerings; and the priest shall burn \add it\add* upon the altar for a sweet savour unto the LORD; and the priest shall make an atonement for him, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 32 And if he bring a lamb for a sin offering, he shall bring it a female without blemish.
\p
\v 33 And he shall lay his hand upon the head of the sin offering, and slay it for a sin offering in the place where they kill the burnt offering.
\p
\v 34 And the priest shall take of the blood of the sin offering with his finger, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar of burnt offering, and shall pour out all the blood thereof at the bottom of the altar:
\p
\v 35 And he shall take away all the fat thereof, as the fat of the lamb is taken away from the sacrifice of the peace offerings; and the priest shall burn it upon the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: and the priest shall make an atonement for his sin that he hath committed, and it shall be forgiven him.

\p
\v 1 ¶ And if a soul sin, and hear the voice of swearing, and \add is\add* a witness, whether he hath seen or known \add of it;\add* if he do not utter \add it,\add* then he shall bear his iniquity.
\p
\v 2 Or if a soul touch any unclean thing, whether \add it be\add* a carcase of an unclean beast, or a carcase of unclean cattle, or the carcase of unclean creeping things, and \add if\add* it be hidden from him; he also shall be unclean, and guilty.
\p
\v 3 Or if he touch the uncleanness of man, whatsoever uncleanness \add it be\add* that a man shall be defiled withal, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth \add of it,\add* then he shall be guilty.
\p
\v 4 Or if a soul swear, pronouncing with \add his\add* lips to do evil, or to do good, whatsoever \add it be\add* that a man shall pronounce with an oath, and it be hid from him; when he knoweth \add of it,\add* then he shall be guilty in one of these.
\p
\v 5 And it shall be, when he shall be guilty in one of these \add things,\add* that he shall confess that he hath sinned in that \add thing:\add*
\p
\v 6 And he shall bring as his guilt offering unto the LORD for his sin which he hath sinned, a female from the flock, a lamb or a kid of the goats, for a sin offering; and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his sin.
\p
\v 7 And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring for his guilty act that he hath committed, two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the LORD; one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.
\p
\v 8 And he shall bring them unto the priest, who shall offer \add that\add* which \add is\add* for the sin offering first, and wring off its head from its neck, but shall not divide \add it\add* asunder:
\p
\v 9 And he shall sprinkle of the blood of the sin offering upon the side of the altar; and the rest of the blood shall be wrung out at the bottom of the altar: it \add is\add* a sin offering.
\p
\v 10 And he shall offer the second \add for\add* a burnt offering, according to the custom: and the priest shall make an atonement for him for his sin which he hath sinned, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 11 ¶ But if he be not able to bring two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, then he that sinned shall bring for his offering the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a sin offering; he shall put no oil upon it, neither shall he put \add any\add* frankincense thereon: for it \add is\add* a sin offering.
\p
\v 12 Then shall he bring it to the priest, and the priest shall take his handful of it, \add even\add* a memorial thereof, and burn \add it\add* on the altar, according to the offerings made by fire unto the LORD: it \add is\add* a sin offering.
\p
\v 13 And the priest shall make an atonement for him as touching his sin that he hath sinned in one of these, and it shall be forgiven him: and \add the remnant\add* shall be the priest’s, as a meal offering.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 15 If a soul commit a trespass, and sin through ignorance, in the holy things of the LORD; then he shall bring for his trespass unto the LORD a ram without blemish out of the flocks, with thy estimation by shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary, for a trespass offering:
\p
\v 16 And he shall make amends for the harm that he hath done in the holy thing, and shall add the fifth part thereto, and give it unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him with the ram of the trespass offering, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And if a soul sin, and commit any of these things which are forbidden to be done by the commandments of the LORD; though he know \add it\add* not, yet is he guilty, and shall bear his iniquity.
\p
\v 18 And he shall bring a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest: and the priest shall make an atonement for him concerning his ignorance wherein he erred and knew \add it\add* not, and it shall be forgiven him.
\p
\v 19 It \add is\add* a trespass offering: he hath certainly trespassed against the LORD.

\cl CHAPTER 6
\p

\v 2 If a soul sin, and commit a trespass against the LORD, and lie unto his neighbour in that which was delivered him to keep, or in fellowship, or in a thing taken away by violence, or hath deceived his neighbour;
\p
\v 3 Or have found that which was lost, and lieth concerning it, and sweareth falsely; in any of all these that a man doeth, sinning therein:
\p
\v 4 Then it shall be, because he hath sinned, and is guilty, that he shall restore that which he took violently away, or the thing which he hath deceitfully gotten, or that which was delivered him to keep, or the lost thing which he found,
\p
\v 5 Or all that about which he hath sworn falsely; he shall even restore it in the principal, and shall add the fifth part more thereto, \add and\add* give it unto him to whom it appertaineth, in the day of his trespass offering.
\p
\v 6 And he shall bring his trespass offering unto the LORD, a ram without blemish out of the flock, with thy estimation, for a trespass offering, unto the priest:
\p
\v 7 And the priest shall make an atonement for him before the LORD: and it shall be forgiven him for any thing for all that he hath done in trespassing therein.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 9 Command Aaron and his sons, saying, This \add is\add* the law of the burnt offering: It \add is\add* the burnt offering, because of the burning upon the altar all night unto the morning, and the fire of the altar shall be burning in it.
\p
\v 10 And the priest shall put on his linen garment, and his linen breeches shall he put upon his flesh, and take up the ashes which the fire hath consumed with the burnt offering on the altar, and he shall put them beside the altar.
\p
\v 11 And he shall put off his garments, and put on other garments, and carry forth the ashes without the camp unto a clean place.
\p
\v 12 And the fire upon the altar shall be burning in it; it shall not be put out: and the priest shall burn wood on it every morning, and lay the burnt offering in order upon it; and he shall burn thereon the fat of the peace offerings.
\p
\v 13 The fire shall ever be burning upon the altar; it shall never go out.

\v 15 And he shall take of it his handful, of the flour of the meal offering, and of the oil thereof, and all the frankincense which \add is\add* upon the meal offering, and shall burn \add it\add* upon the altar \add for\add* a sweet savour, \add even\add* the memorial of it, unto the LORD.

\v 16 And the remainder thereof shall Aaron and his sons eat: with unleavened bread shall it be eaten in the holy place; in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation they shall eat it.
\p
\v 17 It shall not be baken with leaven. I have given it \add unto them for\add* their portion of my offerings made by fire; it \add is\add* most holy, as \add is\add* the sin offering, and as the trespass offering.
\p
\v 18 All the males among the children of Aaron shall eat of it. \add It shall be\add* a statute for ever in your generations concerning the offerings of the LORD made by fire: every one that toucheth them shall be holy.

\v 19 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 20 This \add is\add* the offering of Aaron and of his sons, which they shall offer unto the LORD in the day when he is anointed; the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour for a meal offering perpetual, half of it in the morning, and half thereof at night.
\p
\v 21 In a pan it shall be made with oil; \add and when it is\add* baken, thou shalt bring it in: \add and\add* the baken pieces of the meal offering shalt thou offer \add for\add* a sweet savour unto the LORD.
\p
\v 22 And the priest of his sons that is anointed in his stead shall offer it: \add it is\add* a statute for ever unto the LORD, it shall be wholly burnt.
\p
\v 23 For every meal offering for the priest shall be wholly burnt: it shall not be eaten.

\v 24 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 25 Speak unto Aaron and to his sons, saying, This \add is\add* the law of the sin offering: In the place where the burnt offering is killed shall the sin offering be killed before the LORD: it \add is\add* most holy.
\p
\v 26 The priest that offereth it for sin shall eat it: in the holy place shall it be eaten, in the court of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 27 Whatsoever shall touch the flesh thereof shall be holy: and when there is sprinkled of the blood thereof upon any garment, thou shalt wash that whereon it was sprinkled in the holy place.
\p
\v 28 But the earthen vessel wherein it is boiled shall be broken: and if it be boiled in a brasen pot, it shall be both scoured, and rinsed in water.
\p
\v 29 All the males among the priests shall eat thereof: it \add is\add* most holy.
\p
\v 30 And no sin offering, whereof \add any\add* of the blood is brought into the tabernacle of the congregation to reconcile \add withal\add* in the holy \add place,\add* shall be eaten: it shall be burnt in the fire.

\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Likewise this \add is\add* the law of the trespass offering: it \add is\add* most holy.

\v 2 In the place where they kill the burnt offering shall they kill the trespass offering: and the blood thereof shall he sprinkle round about upon the altar.
\p
\v 3 And he shall offer of it all the fat thereof; the rump, and the fat that covereth the inwards,

\v 4 And the two kidneys, and the fat that \add is\add* on them, which \add is\add* by the flanks, and the caul \add that is\add* above the liver, with the kidneys, it shall he take away:
\p
\v 5 And the priest shall burn them upon the altar \add for\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD: it \add is\add* a trespass offering.
\p
\v 6 Every male among the priests shall eat thereof: it shall be eaten in the holy place: it \add is\add* most holy.
\p
\v 7 As the sin offering \add is,\add* so \add is\add* the trespass offering: \add there is\add* one law for them: the priest that maketh atonement therewith shall have \add it.\add*
\p
\v 8 And the priest that offereth any man’s burnt offering, \add even\add* the priest shall have to himself the skin of the burnt offering which he hath offered.
\p
\v 9 And all the meal offering that is baken in the oven, and all that is dressed in the fryingpan, and in the pan, shall be the priest’s that offereth it.
\p
\v 10 And every meal offering, mingled with oil, and dry, shall all the sons of Aaron have, one \add as much\add* as another.
\p
\v 11 And this \add is\add* the law of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which he shall offer unto the LORD.
\p
\v 12 If he offer it for a thanksgiving, then he shall offer with the sacrifice of thanksgiving unleavened cakes mingled with oil, and unleavened wafers anointed with oil, and cakes mingled with oil, of fine flour, fried.
\p
\v 13 Besides the cakes, he shall offer \add for\add* his offering leavened bread with the sacrifice of thanksgiving of his peace offerings.
\p
\v 14 And of it he shall offer one out of the whole oblation \add for\add* an heave offering unto the LORD, \add and\add* it shall be the priest’s that sprinkleth the blood of the peace offerings.
\p
\v 15 And the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings for thanksgiving shall be eaten the same day that it is offered; he shall not leave any of it until the morning.
\p
\v 16 But if the sacrifice of his offering \add be\add* a vow, or a voluntary offering, it shall be eaten the same day that he offereth his sacrifice: and on the morrow also the remainder of it shall be eaten:
\p
\v 17 But the remainder of the flesh of the sacrifice on the third day shall be burnt with fire.
\p
\v 18 And if \add any\add* of the flesh of the sacrifice of his peace offerings be eaten at all on the third day, it shall not be accepted, neither shall it be imputed unto him that offereth it: it shall be an abomination, and the soul that eateth of it shall bear his iniquity.
\p
\v 19 And the flesh that toucheth any unclean \add thing\add* shall not be eaten; it shall be burnt with fire: and as for the flesh, all that are clean shall eat thereof.
\p
\v 20 But the soul that eateth \add of\add* the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that \add pertain\add* unto the LORD, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 21 Moreover the soul that shall touch any unclean \add thing, as\add* the uncleanness of man, or \add any\add* unclean beast, or any abominable unclean \add thing,\add* and eat of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, which \add pertain\add* unto the LORD, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 23 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Ye shall eat no manner of fat, of ox, or of sheep, or of goat.
\p
\v 24 And the fat of the beast that dieth of itself, and the fat of that which is torn with beasts, may be used in any other use: but ye shall in no wise eat of it.
\p
\v 25 For whosoever eateth the fat of the beast, of which men offer an offering made by fire unto the LORD, even the soul that eateth \add it\add* shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 26 Moreover ye shall eat no manner of blood, \add whether it be\add* of fowl or of beast, in any of your dwellings.
\p
\v 27 Whatsoever soul \add it be\add* that eateth any manner of blood, even that soul shall be cut off from his people.
\p
\v 28 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 29 Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, He that offereth the sacrifice of his peace offerings unto the LORD shall bring his oblation unto the LORD of the sacrifice of his peace offerings.
\p
\v 30 His own hands shall bring the offerings of the LORD made by fire, the fat with the breast, it shall he bring, that the breast may be waved \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD.
\p
\v 31 And the priest shall burn the fat upon the altar: but the breast shall be Aaron’s and his sons’.
\p
\v 32 And the right shoulder shall ye give unto the priest \add for\add* an heave offering of the sacrifices of your peace offerings.
\p
\v 33 He among the sons of Aaron, that offereth the blood of the peace offerings, and the fat, shall have the right shoulder for \add his\add* part.
\p
\v 34 For the wave breast and the heave shoulder have I taken of the children of Israel from off the sacrifices of their peace offerings, and have given them unto Aaron the priest and unto his sons by a statute for ever from among the children of Israel.
\p
\v 35 ¶ This \add is the portion\add* of the anointing of Aaron, and of the anointing of his sons, out of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, in the day \add when\add* he presented them to minister unto the LORD in the priest’s office;
\p
\v 36 Which the LORD commanded to be given them of the children of Israel, in the day that he anointed them, \add by\add* a statute for ever throughout their generations.
\p
\v 37 This \add is\add* the law of the burnt offering, of the meal offering, and of the sin offering, and of the trespass offering, and of the consecrations, and of the sacrifice of the peace offerings;
\p
\v 38 Which the LORD commanded Moses in mount Sinai, in the day that he commanded the children of Israel to offer their oblations unto the LORD, in the wilderness of Sinai.

\v 2 Take Aaron and his sons with him, and the garments, and the anointing oil, and a bullock for the sin offering, and two rams, and a basket of unleavened bread;
\p
\v 3 And gather thou all the congregation together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 4 And Moses did as the LORD commanded him; and the assembly was gathered together unto the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.
\p
\v 5 And Moses said unto the congregation, This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD commanded to be done.
\p
\v 6 And Moses brought Aaron and his sons, and washed them with water.
\p
\v 7 And he put upon him the coat, and girded him with the girdle, and clothed him with the robe, and put the ephod upon him, and he girded him with the curious girdle of the ephod, and bound \add it\add* unto him therewith.
\p
\v 8 And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.
\p
\v 9 And he put the mitre upon his head; also upon the mitre, \add even\add* upon his forefront, did he put the golden plate, the holy crown; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 10 And Moses took the anointing oil, and anointed the tabernacle and all that \add was\add* therein, and sanctified them.
\p
\v 11 And he sprinkled thereof upon the altar seven times, and anointed the altar and all its vessels, both the laver and its foot, to sanctify them.
\p
\v 12 And he poured of the anointing oil upon Aaron’s head, and anointed him, to sanctify him.
\p
\v 13 And Moses brought Aaron’s sons, and put coats upon them, and girded them with girdles, and put bonnets upon them; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 14 And he brought the bullock for the sin offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the bullock for the sin offering.
\p
\v 15 And he slew \add it;\add* and Moses took the blood, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar round about with his finger, and purified the altar, and poured the blood at the bottom of the altar, and sanctified it, to make atonement upon it.
\p
\v 16 And he took all the fat that \add was\add* upon the inwards, and the caul \add above\add* the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and Moses burned \add it\add* upon the altar.
\p
\v 17 But the bullock, and its hide, its flesh, and its dung, he burnt with fire without the camp; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And he brought the ram for the burnt offering: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
\p
\v 19 And he killed \add it;\add* and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
\p
\v 20 And he cut the ram into pieces; and Moses burnt the head, and the pieces, and the fat.
\p
\v 21 And he washed the inwards and the legs in water; and Moses burnt the whole ram upon the altar: it \add was\add* a burnt sacrifice for a sweet savour, \add and\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 22 ¶ And he brought the other ram, the ram of consecration: and Aaron and his sons laid their hands upon the head of the ram.
\p
\v 23 And he slew \add it;\add* and Moses took of the blood of it, and put \add it\add* upon the tip of Aaron’s right ear, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot.
\p
\v 24 And he brought Aaron’s sons, and Moses put of the blood upon the tip of their right ear, and upon the thumbs of their right hands, and upon the great toes of their right feet: and Moses sprinkled the blood upon the altar round about.
\p
\v 25 And he took the fat, and the rump, and all the fat that \add was\add* upon the inwards, and the caul \add above\add* the liver, and the two kidneys, and their fat, and the right shoulder:
\p
\v 26 And out of the basket of unleavened bread, that \add was\add* before the LORD, he took one unleavened cake, and a cake of oiled bread, and one wafer, and put \add them\add* on the fat, and upon the right shoulder:
\p
\v 27 And he put all upon Aaron’s hands, and upon his sons’ hands, and waved them \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD.
\p
\v 28 And Moses took them from off their hands, and burnt \add them\add* on the altar upon the burnt offering: they \add were\add* consecrations for a sweet savour: it \add is\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\p
\v 29 And Moses took the breast, and waved it \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD: \add for\add* of the ram of consecration it was Moses’ part; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 30 And Moses took of the anointing oil, and of the blood which \add was\add* upon the altar, and sprinkled \add it\add* upon Aaron, \add and\add* upon his garments, and upon his sons, and upon his sons’ garments with him; and sanctified Aaron, \add and\add* his garments, and his sons, and his sons’ garments with him.

\v 31 ¶ And Moses said unto Aaron and to his sons, Boil the flesh at the door of the tabernacle of the congregation: and there eat it with the bread that \add is\add* in the basket of consecrations, as I commanded, saying, Aaron and his sons shall eat it.
\p
\v 32 And that which remaineth of the flesh and of the bread shall ye burn with fire.
\p
\v 33 And ye shall not go out of the door of the tabernacle of the congregation \add in\add* seven days, until the days of your consecration be at an end: for seven days shall he consecrate you.

\v 34 As he hath done this day, \add so\add* the LORD hath commanded to do, to make an atonement for you.

\v 35 Therefore shall ye abide \add at\add* the door of the tabernacle of the congregation day and night seven days, and keep the charge of the LORD, that ye die not: for so I am commanded.

\p

\v 2 And he said unto Aaron, Take thee a young calf for a sin offering, and a ram for a burnt offering, without blemish, and offer \add them\add* before the LORD.
\p
\v 3 And unto the children of Israel thou shalt speak, saying, Take ye a kid of the goats for a sin offering; and a calf and a lamb, \add both\add* of the first year, without blemish, for a burnt offering;

\v 4 Also a bullock and a ram for peace offerings, to sacrifice before the LORD; and a meal offering mingled with oil: for to day the LORD will appear unto you.

\v 5 ¶ And they brought \add that\add* which Moses commanded before the tabernacle of the congregation: and all the congregation drew near and stood before the LORD.
\p
\v 6 And Moses said, This \add is\add* the thing which the LORD commanded that ye should do: and the glory of the LORD shall appear unto you.
\p
\v 7 And Moses said unto Aaron, Go unto the altar, and offer thy sin offering, and thy burnt offering, and make an atonement for thyself, and for the people: and offer the offering of the people, and make an atonement for them; as the LORD commanded.
\p
\v 8 ¶ Aaron therefore went unto the altar, and slew the calf of the sin offering, which \add was\add* for himself.
\p
\v 9 And the sons of Aaron brought the blood unto him: and he dipped his finger in the blood, and put \add it\add* upon the horns of the altar, and poured out the blood at the bottom of the altar:
\p
\v 10 But the fat, and the kidneys, and the caul above the liver of the sin offering, he burnt upon the altar; as the LORD commanded Moses.
\p
\v 11 And the flesh and the hide he burnt with fire without the camp.
\p
\v 12 And he slew the burnt offering; and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled round about upon the altar.
\p
\v 13 And they presented the burnt offering unto him, with the pieces thereof, and the head: and he burnt \add them\add* upon the altar.
\p
\v 14 And he did wash the inwards and the legs, and burnt \add them\add* upon the burnt offering on the altar.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And he brought the people’s offering, and took the goat, which \add was\add* the sin offering for the people, and slew it, and offered it for sin, as the first.
\p
\v 16 And he brought the burnt offering, and offered it according to the prescribed manner.
\p
\v 17 And he brought the meal offering, and took an handful thereof, and burnt \add it\add* upon the altar, beside the burnt sacrifice of the morning.
\p
\v 18 He slew also the bullock and the ram \add for\add* a sacrifice of peace offerings, which \add was\add* for the people: and Aaron’s sons presented unto him the blood, which he sprinkled upon the altar round about,

\v 19 And the fat of the bullock and of the ram, the rump, and that which covereth \add the inwards,\add* and the kidneys, and the caul \add above\add* the liver:
\p
\v 20 And they put the fat upon the breasts, and he burnt the fat upon the altar:

\v 21 And the breasts and the right shoulder Aaron waved \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD; as Moses commanded.
\p
\v 22 And Aaron lifted up his hand toward the people, and blessed them, and came down from offering of the sin offering, and the burnt offering, and peace offerings.
\p
\v 23 And Moses and Aaron went into the tabernacle of the congregation, and came out, and blessed the people: and the glory of the LORD appeared unto all the people.

\p
\v 3 Then Moses said unto Aaron, This \add is it\add* that the LORD spake, saying, I will be sanctified in them that come nigh me, and before all the people I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace.

\v 4 And Moses called Mishael and Elzaphan, the sons of Uzziel the uncle of Aaron, and said unto them, Come near, carry your brethren from before the sanctuary out of the camp.
\p
\v 5 So they went near, and carried them in their coats out of the camp; as Moses had said.
\p
\v 6 And Moses said unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons, Uncover not your heads, neither rend your clothes; lest ye die, and lest wrath come upon all the people: but let your brethren, the whole house of Israel, bewail the burning which the LORD hath kindled.
\p
\v 7 And ye shall not go out from the door of the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: for the anointing oil of the LORD \add is\add* upon you. And they did according to the word of Moses.

\v 8 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Aaron, saying,
\p
\v 9 Do not drink wine nor strong drink, thou, nor thy sons with thee, when ye go into the tabernacle of the congregation, lest ye die: \add it shall be\add* a statute for ever throughout your generations:
\p
\v 10 And that ye may put difference between holy and unholy, and between unclean and clean;
\p
\v 11 And that ye may teach the children of Israel all the statutes which the LORD hath spoken unto them by the hand of Moses.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And Moses spake unto Aaron, and unto Eleazar and unto Ithamar, his sons that were left, Take the meal offering that remaineth of the offerings of the LORD made by fire, and eat it without leaven beside the altar: for it \add is\add* most holy:
\p
\v 13 And ye shall eat it in the holy place, because it \add is\add* thy due, and thy sons’ due, of the sacrifices of the LORD made by fire: for so I am commanded.

\v 14 And the wave breast and heave shoulder shall ye eat in a clean place; thou, and thy sons, and thy daughters with thee: for these are thy due, and thy sons’ due, \add which\add* are given out of the sacrifices of peace offerings of the children of Israel.
\p
\v 15 The heave shoulder and the wave breast shall they bring with the offerings made by fire of the fat, to wave \add it for\add* a wave offering before the LORD; and it shall be thine, and thy sons’ with thee, by a statute for ever; as the LORD hath commanded.

\v 17 Wherefore have ye not eaten the sin offering in the holy place, seeing it \add is\add* most holy, and \add God\add* hath given it you to bear the iniquity of the congregation, to make atonement for them before the LORD?

\v 13 Then the priest shall consider: and, behold, \add if\add* the leprosy have covered all his flesh, he shall pronounce \add him\add* clean \add that hath\add* the plague: it is all turned white: he \add is\add* clean.
\p
\v 14 But when raw flesh appeareth in him, he shall be unclean.
\p
\v 15 And the priest shall see the raw flesh, and pronounce him to be unclean: \add for\add* the raw flesh \add is\add* unclean: it \add is\add* a leprosy.
\p
\v 16 Or if the raw flesh turn again, and be changed unto white, he shall come unto the priest;
\p
\v 17 And the priest shall see him: and, behold, \add if\add* the plague be turned into white; then the priest shall pronounce \add him\add* clean \add that hath\add* the plague: he \add is\add* clean.
\p
\v 18 ¶ The flesh also, in which, \add even\add* in the skin thereof, was a boil, and is healed,
\p
\v 19 And in the place of the boil there be a white rising, or a bright spot, white, and somewhat reddish, and it be showed to the priest;
\p
\v 20 And if, when the priest seeth it, behold, it \add be\add* in sight lower than the skin, and the hair thereof be turned white; the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* a plague of leprosy broken out of the boil.
\p
\v 21 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, \add there be\add* no white hairs therein, and \add if\add* it \add be\add* not lower than the skin, but somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
\p
\v 22 And if it spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* a plague.
\p
\v 23 But if the bright spot stay in its place, \add and\add* spread not, it \add is\add* a burning boil; and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\p
\v 24 ¶ Or if there be \add any\add* flesh, in the skin whereof \add there is\add* a hot burning, and the living \add flesh\add* that burneth have a white bright spot, somewhat reddish, or white;
\p
\v 25 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, \add if\add* the hair in the bright spot be turned white, and it \add be in\add* sight deeper than the skin; it \add is\add* a leprosy broken out of the burning: wherefore the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* the plague of leprosy.
\p
\v 26 But if the priest look on it, and, behold, \add there be\add* no white hair in the bright spot, and it \add be\add* no lower than the \add other\add* skin, but \add be\add* somewhat dark; then the priest shall shut him up seven days:
\p
\v 27 And the priest shall look upon him the seventh day: \add and\add* if it be spread much abroad in the skin, then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* the plague of leprosy.
\p
\v 28 And if the bright spot stay in its place, \add and\add* spread not in the skin, but it \add be\add* somewhat dark; it \add is\add* a rising of the burning, and the priest shall pronounce him clean: for it \add is\add* an inflammation of the burning.
\p
\v 29 ¶ If a man or woman have a plague upon the head or the beard;
\p
\v 30 Then the priest shall see the plague: and, behold, if it \add be\add* in sight deeper than the skin; \add and there be\add* in it a yellow thin hair; then the priest shall pronounce him unclean: it \add is\add* a dry scall, \add even\add* a leprosy upon the head or beard.
\p
\v 31 And if the priest look on the plague of the scall, and, behold, it \add be\add* not in sight deeper than the skin, and \add that there is\add* no black hair in it; then the priest shall shut up \add him that hath\add* the plague of the scall seven days:
\p
\v 32 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the plague: and, behold, \add if\add* the scall spread not, and there be in it no yellow hair, and the scall \add be\add* not in sight deeper than the skin;
\p
\v 33 He shall be shaven, but the scall shall he not shave; and the priest shall shut up \add him that hath\add* the scall seven days more:
\p
\v 34 And in the seventh day the priest shall look on the scall: and, behold, \add if\add* the scall be not spread in the skin, nor \add be\add* in sight deeper than the skin; then the priest shall pronounce him clean: and he shall wash his clothes, and be clean.
\p
\v 35 But if the scall spread much in the skin after his cleansing;
\p
\v 36 Then the priest shall look on him: and, behold, if the scall be spread in the skin, the priest shall not seek for yellow hair; he \add is\add* unclean.
\p
\v 37 But if the scall be in his sight at a stay, and \add that\add* there is black hair grown up therein; the scall is healed, he \add is\add* clean: and the priest shall pronounce him clean.
\p
\v 38 ¶ If a man also or a woman have in the skin of their flesh bright spots, \add even\add* white bright spots;
\p
\v 39 Then the priest shall look: and, behold, \add if\add* the bright spots in the skin of their flesh \add be\add* darkish white; it \add is\add* a freckled spot \add that\add* groweth in the skin; he \add is\add* clean.
\p
\v 40 And the man whose hair is fallen off his head, he \add is\add* bald; \add yet is\add* he clean.
\p
\v 41 And he that hath his hair fallen off from the part of his head toward his face, he \add is\add* forehead bald: \add yet is\add* he clean.
\p
\v 42 And if there be in the bald head, or bald forehead, a white reddish sore; it \add is\add* a leprosy sprung up in his bald head, or his bald forehead.
\p
\v 43 Then the priest shall look upon it: and, behold, \add if\add* the rising of the sore \add be\add* white reddish in his bald head, or in his bald forehead, as the leprosy appeareth in the skin of the flesh;
\p
\v 44 He is a leprous man, he \add is\add* unclean: the priest shall pronounce him utterly unclean; his plague \add is\add* in his head.
\p
\v 45 And the leper in whom the plague \add is,\add* his clothes shall be rent, and his head bare, and he shall put a covering upon his upper lip, and shall cry, Unclean, unclean.
\p
\v 46 All the days wherein the plague \add shall be\add* in him he shall be defiled; he \add is\add* unclean: he shall dwell alone; without the camp \add shall\add* his habitation \add be.\add*
\p
\v 47 ¶ The garment also that the plague of leprosy is in, \add whether it be\add* a woollen garment, or a linen garment;
\p
\v 48 Whether \add it be\add* in the warp, or woof; of linen, or of woollen; whether in a skin, or in any thing made of skin;
\p
\v 49 And if the plague be greenish or reddish in the garment, or in the skin, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it \add is\add* a plague of leprosy, and shall be showed unto the priest:
\p
\v 50 And the priest shall look upon the plague, and shut up \add it that hath\add* the plague seven days:
\p
\v 51 And he shall look on the plague on the seventh day: if the plague be spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in a skin, \add or\add* in any work that is made of skin; the plague \add is\add* a fretting leprosy; it \add is\add* unclean.
\p
\v 52 He shall therefore burn that garment, whether warp or woof, in woollen or in linen, or any thing of skin, wherein the plague is: for it \add is\add* a fretting leprosy; it shall be burnt in the fire.
\p
\v 53 And if the priest shall look, and, behold, the plague be not spread in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin;
\p
\v 54 Then the priest shall command that they wash \add the thing\add* wherein the plague \add is,\add* and he shall shut it up seven days more:
\p
\v 55 And the priest shall look on the plague, after that it is washed: and, behold, \add if\add* the plague have not changed its colour, and the plague be not spread; it \add is\add* unclean; thou shalt burn it in the fire; it \add is\add* fret inward, \add whether\add* it \add be\add* bare within or without.
\p
\v 56 And if the priest look, and, behold, the plague \add be\add* somewhat dark after the washing of it; then he shall rend it out of the garment, or out of the skin, or out of the warp, or out of the woof:
\p
\v 57 And if it appear still in the garment, either in the warp, or in the woof, or in any thing of skin; it \add is\add* a spreading \add plague:\add* thou shalt burn that wherein the plague \add is\add* with fire.
\p
\v 58 And the garment, either warp, or woof, or whatsoever thing of skin \add it be,\add* which thou shalt wash, if the plague be departed from them, then it shall be washed the second time, and shall be clean.
\p
\v 59 This \add is\add* the law of the plague of leprosy in a garment of woollen or linen, either in the warp, or woof, or any thing of skins, to pronounce it clean, or to pronounce it unclean.

\cl CHAPTER 14
\p

\v 3 And the priest shall go forth out of the camp; and the priest shall look, and, behold, \add if\add* the plague of leprosy be healed in the leper;
\p
\v 4 Then shall the priest command to take for him that is to be cleansed two birds alive \add and\add* clean, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:
\p
\v 5 And the priest shall command that one of the birds be killed in an earthen vessel over running water:
\p
\v 6 As for the living bird, he shall take it, and the cedar wood, and the scarlet, and the hyssop, and shall dip them and the living bird in the blood of the bird \add that was\add* killed over the running water:
\p
\v 7 And he shall sprinkle upon him that is to be cleansed from the leprosy seven times, and shall pronounce him clean, and shall let the living bird loose into the open field.

\v 8 And he that is to be cleansed shall wash his clothes, and shave off all his hair, and wash himself in water, that he may be clean: and after that he shall come into the camp, and shall tarry abroad out of his tent seven days.

\v 9 But it shall be on the seventh day, that he shall shave all his hair off his head and his beard and his eyebrows, even all his hair he shall shave off: and he shall wash his clothes, also he shall wash his flesh in water, and he shall be clean.
\p
\v 10 And on the eighth day he shall take two he lambs without blemish, and one ewe lamb of the first year without blemish, and three tenth deals of fine flour \add for\add* a meal offering, mingled with oil, and one log of oil.

\v 12 And the priest shall take one he lamb, and offer him for a trespass offering, and the log of oil, and wave them \add for\add* a wave offering before the LORD:
\p
\v 13 And he shall slay the lamb in the place where he shall kill the sin offering and the burnt offering, in the holy place: for as the sin offering \add is\add* the priest’s, \add so is\add* the trespass offering: it \add is\add* most holy:
\p
\v 14 And the priest shall take \add some\add* of the blood of the trespass offering, and the priest shall put \add it\add* upon the tip of the right ear of him that is to be cleansed, and upon the thumb of his right hand, and upon the great toe of his right foot:

\v 35 And he that owneth the house shall come and tell the priest, saying, It seemeth to me \add there is\add* as it were a plague in the house:

\p
\v 40 Then the priest shall command that they take away the stones in which the plague \add is,\add* and they shall cast them into an unclean place without the city:
\p
\v 41 And he shall cause the house to be scraped within round about, and they shall pour out the dust that they scrape off without the city into an unclean place:

\v 42 And they shall take other stones, and put \add them\add* in the place of those stones; and he shall take other mortar, and shall plaster the house.
\p
\v 43 And if the plague come again, and break out in the house, after that he hath taken away the stones, and after he hath scraped the house, and after it is plaistered;
\p
\v 44 Then the priest shall come and look, and, behold, \add if\add* the plague be spread in the house, it \add is\add* a fretting leprosy in the house: it is unclean.
\p
\v 45 And he shall break down the house, the stones of it, and the timber thereof, and all the mortar of the house; and he shall carry \add them\add* forth out of the city into an unclean place.
\p
\v 46 Moreover he that goeth into the house all the while that it is shut up shall be unclean until the even.
\p
\v 47 And he that lieth in the house shall wash his clothes; and he that eateth in the house shall wash his clothes.
\p
\v 48 And if the priest shall come in, and look \add upon it,\add* and, behold, the plague hath not spread in the house, after the house was plastered: then the priest shall pronounce the house clean, because the plague is healed.

\v 49 And he shall take to cleanse the house two birds, and cedar wood, and scarlet, and hyssop:

\v 33 And he shall make an atonement for the holy sanctuary, and he shall make an atonement for the tabernacle of the congregation, and for the altar, and he shall make an atonement for the priests, and for all the people of the congregation.

\p
\v 11 For the life of the flesh \add is\add* in the blood: and I have given it to you upon the altar to make an atonement for your souls: for it \add is\add* the blood \add that\add* maketh an atonement for the soul.
\p
\v 12 Therefore I said unto the children of Israel, No soul of you shall eat blood, neither shall any stranger that sojourneth among you eat blood.
\p
\v 13 And whatsoever man \add there be\add* of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn among you, which hunteth and catcheth any beast or fowl that may be eaten; he shall even pour out the blood thereof, and cover it with dust.
\p
\v 14 For \add it is\add* the life of all flesh; the blood of it \add is\add* for the life thereof: therefore I said unto the children of Israel, Ye shall eat the blood of no manner of flesh: for the life of all flesh \add is\add* the blood thereof: whosoever eateth it shall be cut off.
\p
\v 15 And every soul that eateth that which died \add of itself,\add* or that which was torn \add with beasts, whether it be\add* one of your own country, or a stranger, he shall both wash his clothes, and bathe \add himself\add* in water, and be unclean until the even: then shall he be clean.

\v 17 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 18 Speak unto Aaron, and to his sons, and unto all the children of Israel, and say unto them, Whosoever \add he be\add* of the house of Israel, or of the strangers in Israel, that will offer his oblation for all his vows, and for all his freewill offerings, which they will offer unto the LORD for a burnt offering;
\p
\v 19 \add Ye shall offer\add* acceptably a male without blemish, of the beeves, of the sheep, or of the goats.
\p
\v 20 \add But\add* whatsoever hath a blemish, \add that\add* shall ye not offer: for it shall not be acceptable for you.
\p
\v 21 And whosoever offereth a sacrifice of peace offerings unto the LORD to accomplish \add his\add* vow, or a freewill offering in beeves or sheep, it shall be perfect to be accepted; there shall be no blemish therein.
\p
\v 22 Blind, or broken, or maimed, or having a wen, or scurvy, or scabbed, ye shall not offer these unto the LORD, nor make an offering by fire of them upon the altar unto the LORD.
\p
\v 23 Either a bullock or a lamb that hath any thing superfluous or lacking in his parts, that mayest thou offer \add for\add* a freewill offering; but for a vow it shall not be accepted.
\p
\v 24 Ye shall not offer unto the LORD that which is bruised, or crushed, or broken, or cut; neither shall ye make \add any offering thereof\add* in your land.
\p
\v 25 Neither from a stranger’s hand shall ye offer the bread of your God of any of these; because their corruption \add is\add* in them, \add and\add* blemishes \add be\add* in them: they shall not be accepted for you.
\p
\v 26 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 27 When a bullock, or a sheep, or a goat, is brought forth, then it shall be seven days under the dam; and from the eighth day and thenceforth it shall be accepted for an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\p
\v 28 And \add whether it be\add* cow or ewe, ye shall not kill it and her young both in one day.
\p
\v 29 And when ye will offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving unto the LORD, offer \add it\add* that ye be accepted.
\p
\v 30 On the same day it shall be eaten up; ye shall leave none of it until the morrow: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 31 Therefore shall ye keep my commandments, and do them: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 32 Neither shall ye profane my holy name; but I will be hallowed among the children of Israel: I \add am\add* the LORD who have hallowed you,
\p
\v 33 That brought you out of the land of Egypt, to be your God: I \add am\add* the LORD.

\v 16 Even unto the morrow after the seventh sabbath shall ye number fifty days; and ye shall offer a new meal offering unto the LORD.
\p
\v 17 Ye shall bring out of your habitations two wave loaves of two tenth deals: they shall be of fine flour; they shall be baken with leaven; \add they are\add* the firstfruits unto the LORD.

\v 22 ¶ And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not make clean riddance of the corners of thy field when thou reapest, neither shalt thou gather any gleaning of thy harvest: thou shalt leave them unto the poor, and to the stranger: I \add am\add* the LORD your God.

\cl CHAPTER 24
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Command the children of Israel, that they bring unto thee pure oil olive beaten for the light, to cause the lamps to burn continually.
\p
\v 3 Without the vail of the testimony, in the tabernacle of the congregation, shall Aaron order it from the evening unto the morning before the LORD continually: \add it shall be\add* a statute for ever in all your generations.
\p
\v 4 He shall order the lamps upon the pure candlestick before the LORD continually.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And thou shalt take fine flour, and bake twelve cakes thereof: two tenth deals shall be in one cake.
\p
\v 6 And thou shalt set them in two rows, six on a row, upon the pure table before the LORD.
\p
\v 7 And thou shalt put pure frankincense upon \add each\add* row, that it may be on the bread for a memorial, \add even\add* an offering made by fire unto the LORD.
\p
\v 8 Every sabbath he shall set it in order before the LORD continually, \add being taken\add* from the children of Israel by an everlasting covenant.
\p
\v 9 And it shall be Aaron’s and his sons’; and they shall eat it in the holy place: for it \add is\add* most holy unto him of the offerings of the LORD made by fire by a perpetual statute.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father \add was\add* an Egyptian, went out among the children of Israel: and this son of the Israelitish \add woman\add* and a man of Israel strove together in the camp;
\p
\v 11 And the Israelitish woman’s son blasphemed the name \add of the LORD,\add* and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother’s name \add was\add* Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)
\p
\v 12 And they put him in ward, that the mind of the LORD might be showed them.
\p
\v 13 And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 14 Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp; and let all that heard \add him\add* lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation stone him.
\p
\v 15 And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, Whosoever curseth his God shall bear his sin.
\p
\v 16 And he that blasphemeth the name of the LORD, he shall surely be put to death, \add and\add* all the congregation shall certainly stone him: as well the stranger, as he that is born in the land, when he blasphemeth the name \add of the LORD,\add* shall be put to death.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And he that killeth any man shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 18 And he that killeth a beast shall make it good; beast for beast.
\p
\v 19 And if a man cause a blemish in his neighbour; as he hath done, so shall it be done to him;

\v 20 Breach for breach, eye for eye, tooth for tooth: as he hath caused a blemish in a man, so shall it be done to him \add again.\add*
\p
\v 21 And he that killeth a beast, he shall restore it: and he that killeth a man, he shall be put to death.

\v 22 Ye shall have one custom of law, as well for the stranger, as for one of your own country: for I \add am\add* the LORD your God.

\cl CHAPTER 25
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses in mount Sinai, saying,
\p
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye come into the land which I give you, then shall the land keep a sabbath unto the LORD.
\p
\v 3 Six years thou shalt sow thy field, and six years thou shalt prune thy vineyard, and gather in the fruit thereof;
\p
\v 4 But in the seventh year shall be a sabbath of rest unto the land, a sabbath for the LORD: thou shalt neither sow thy field, nor prune thy vineyard.
\p
\v 5 That which groweth of its own accord of thy harvest thou shalt not reap, neither gather the grapes of thy vine undressed: \add for\add* it is a year of rest unto the land.
\p
\v 6 And the sabbath of the land shall be food for you; for thee, and for thy servant, and for thy maid, and for thy hired servant, and for thy stranger that sojourneth with thee,
\p
\v 7 And for thy cattle, and for the beast that \add are\add* in thy land, shall all the increase thereof be food.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And thou shalt number seven sabbaths of years unto thee, seven times seven years; and the space of the seven sabbaths of years shall be unto thee forty and nine years.
\p
\v 9 Then shalt thou cause the trumpet of the jubile to sound on the tenth \add day\add* of the seventh month, in the day of atonement shall ye make the trumpet sound throughout all your land.
\p
\v 10 And ye shall hallow the fiftieth year, and proclaim liberty throughout \add all\add* the land unto all the inhabitants thereof: it shall be a jubilee unto you; and ye shall return every man unto his possession, and ye shall return every man unto his family.
\p
\v 11 A jubilee shall that fiftieth year be unto you: ye shall not sow, neither reap that which groweth of itself in it, nor gather \add the grapes\add* in it of thy vine undressed.
\p
\v 12 For it \add is\add* the jubilee; it shall be holy unto you: ye shall eat the increase thereof out of the field.
\p
\v 13 In the year of this jubilee ye shall return every man unto his possession.
\p
\v 14 And if thou sell aught unto thy neighbour, or buyest aught of thy neighbour’s hand, ye shall not oppress one another:
\p
\v 15 According to the number of years after the jubilee thou shalt buy of thy neighbour, \add and\add* according unto the number of years of the fruits he shall sell unto thee:
\p
\v 16 According to the multitude of years thou shalt increase the price thereof, and according to the fewness of years thou shalt diminish the price of it: for \add according\add* to the number \add of the years\add* of the fruits doth he sell unto thee.
\p
\v 17 Ye shall not therefore oppress one another; but thou shalt fear thy God: for I \add am\add* the LORD your God.
\p
\v 18 Wherefore ye shall do my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them; and ye shall dwell in the land in safety.
\p
\v 19 And the land shall yield her fruit, and ye shall eat your fill, and dwell therein in safety.
\p
\v 20 And if ye shall say, What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we shall not sow, nor gather in our increase:
\p
\v 21 Then I will command my blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth fruit for three years.
\p
\v 22 And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat \add yet\add* of old fruit until the ninth year; until the fruits come in ye shall eat \add of\add* the old \add store.\add*
\p
\v 23 ¶ The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land \add is\add* mine; for ye \add are\add* strangers and sojourners with me.
\p
\v 24 And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.
\p
\v 25 ¶ If thy brother be waxen poor, and hath sold away \add some\add* of his possession, and if any of his kin come to redeem it, then shall he redeem that which his brother sold.
\p
\v 26 And if the man have none to redeem it, and himself be able to redeem it;
\p
\v 27 Then let him count the years of the sale thereof, and restore the overplus unto the man to whom he sold it; that he may return unto his possession.
\p
\v 28 But if he be not able to restore \add it\add* to him, then that which is sold shall remain in the hand of him that hath bought it until the year of jubilee: and in the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.
\p
\v 29 And if a man sell a dwelling house in a walled city, then he may redeem it within a whole year after it is sold; \add within\add* a full year may he redeem it.
\p
\v 30 And if it be not redeemed within the space of a full year, then the house that \add is\add* in the walled city shall be established for ever to him that bought it throughout his generations: it shall not go out in the jubilee.
\p
\v 31 But the houses of the villages which have no wall round about them shall be counted as the fields of the country: they may be redeemed, and they shall go out in the jubilee.
\p
\v 32 Notwithstanding the cities of the Levites, \add and\add* the houses of the cities of their possession, may the Levites redeem at any time.
\p
\v 33 And if a man of the Levites does not redeem it, then the house that was sold, and the city of his possession, shall go out in \add the year of\add* jubilee: for the houses of the cities of the Levites \add are\add* their possession among the children of Israel.
\p
\v 34 But the field of the suburbs of their cities may not be sold; for it is their perpetual possession.
\p
\v 35 ¶ And if thy brother be waxen poor, and fallen in decay with thee; then thou shalt relieve him: \add yea, as if he were\add* a stranger, or a sojourner; so shall he live with thee.
\p
\v 36 Take thou no usury of him, or increase: but fear thy God; that thy brother may live with thee.
\p
\v 37 Thou shalt not give him thy money upon usury, nor lend him thy victuals for increase.
\p
\v 38 I \add am\add* the LORD your God, who brought you forth out of the land of Egypt, to give you the land of Canaan, \add and\add* to be your God.
\p
\v 39 ¶ And if thy brother \add that dwelleth\add* by thee be waxen poor, and be sold unto thee; thou shalt not compel him to serve as a bondservant:
\p
\v 40 \add But\add* as an hired servant, \add and\add* as a sojourner, he shall be with thee, \add and\add* shall serve thee unto the year of jubilee:
\p
\v 41 And \add then\add* shall he depart from thee, \add both\add* he and his children with him, and shall return unto his own family, and unto the possession of his fathers shall he return.
\p
\v 42 For they \add are\add* my servants, which I brought forth out of the land of Egypt: they shall not be sold as bondmen.
\p
\v 43 Thou shalt not rule over him with rigour; but shalt fear thy God.
\p
\v 44 But thy bondmen, and thy bondmaids, whom thou mayest hold, \add shall be\add* of the nations that are round about you; of them shall ye buy bondmen and bondmaids.
\p
\v 45 Moreover of the children of the strangers that do sojourn among you, of them shall ye buy, and of their families that \add are\add* with you, which they begat in your land: and they shall be your possession.
\p
\v 46 And ye shall take them as an inheritance for your children after you, to inherit \add them for\add* a possession; they shall be your bondmen for ever: but over your brethren the children of Israel, ye shall not rule one over another with rigour.
\p
\v 47 ¶ And if a sojourner or stranger wax rich by thee, and thy brother \add that dwelleth\add* by him wax poor, and sell himself unto the stranger \add or\add* sojourner by thee, or to the stock of the stranger’s family:
\p
\v 48 After that he is sold he may be redeemed again; one of his brethren may redeem him:
\p
\v 49 Either his uncle, or his uncle’s son, may redeem him, or \add any\add* that is nigh of kin unto him of his family may redeem him; or if he be able, he may redeem himself.
\p
\v 50 And he shall reckon with him that bought him from the year that he was sold to him unto the year of jubilee: and the price of his sale shall be according unto the number of years, according to the time of an hired servant shall it be with him.
\p
\v 51 If \add there be\add* yet many years \add behind,\add* according unto them he shall give again the price of his redemption out of the money that he was bought for.
\p
\v 52 And if there remain but few years unto the year of jubilee, then he shall count with him, \add and\add* according unto his years shall he give him again the price of his redemption.
\p
\v 53 \add And\add* as a yearly hired servant shall he be with him: \add and the other\add* shall not rule with rigour over him in thy sight.
\p
\v 54 And if he be not redeemed in these \add years,\add* then he shall go out in the year of jubilee, \add both\add* he, and his children with him.
\p

\v 16 I also will do this unto you; I will even appoint over you terror, consumption, and the burning ague, that shall consume the eyes, and cause sorrow of heart: and ye shall sow your seed in vain, for your enemies shall eat it.
\p
\v 17 And I will set my face against you, and ye shall be slain before your enemies: they that hate you shall reign over you; and ye shall flee when none pursueth you.

\v 18 And if ye will not yet for all this hearken unto me, then I will punish you seven times more for your sins.
\p
\v 19 And I will break the pride of your power; and I will make your heaven as iron, and your earth as brass:

\v 20 And your strength shall be spent in vain: for your land shall not yield her increase, neither shall the trees of the land yield their fruits.
\p
\v 21 ¶ And if ye walk contrary unto me, and will not hearken unto me; I will bring seven times more plagues upon you according to your sins.
\p
\v 22 I will also send wild beasts among you, which shall rob you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number; and your \add high\add* ways shall be desolate.

\v 24 Then will I also walk contrary unto you, and will punish you yet seven times for your sins.
\p
\v 25 And I will bring a sword upon you, that shall avenge the breach of \add my\add* covenant: and when ye are gathered together within your cities, I will send the pestilence among you; and ye shall be delivered into the hand of the enemy.

\v 37 And they shall fall one upon another, as it were before a sword, when none pursueth: and ye shall have no power to stand before your enemies.

\v 38 And ye shall perish among the nations, and the land of your enemies shall eat you up.
\p
\v 39 And they that are left of you shall pine away in their iniquity in your enemies’ lands; and also in the iniquities of their fathers shall they pine away with them.
\p
\v 40 If they shall confess their iniquity, and the iniquity of their fathers, with their trespass which they trespassed against me, and that also they have walked contrary unto me;
\p
\v 41 And \add that\add* I also have walked contrary unto them, and have brought them into the land of their enemies; if then their uncircumcised hearts be humbled, and they then accept of the punishment of their iniquity:
\p
\v 42 Then will I remember my covenant with Jacob, and also my covenant with Isaac, and also my covenant with Abraham will I remember; and I will remember the land.
\p
\v 43 The land also shall be left of them, and shall enjoy her sabbaths, while she lieth desolate without them: and they shall accept of the punishment of their iniquity: because, even because they despised my judgments, and because their soul abhorred my statutes.
\p
\v 44 And yet for all that, when they be in the land of their enemies, I will not cast them away, neither will I abhor them, to destroy them utterly, and to break my covenant with them: for I \add am\add* the LORD their God.
\p
\v 45 But I will for their sakes remember the covenant of their ancestors, whom I brought forth out of the land of Egypt in the sight of the nations, that I might be their God: I \add am\add* the LORD.
\p
\v 46 These \add are\add* the statutes and judgments and laws, which the LORD made between him and the children of Israel in mount Sinai by the hand of Moses.

\cl CHAPTER 27
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
\p
\v 2 Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When a man shall make a singular vow, the persons \add shall be\add* for the LORD by thy estimation.
\p
\v 3 And thy estimation shall be of the male from twenty years old even unto sixty years old, even thy estimation shall be fifty shekels of silver, after the shekel of the sanctuary.
\p
\v 4 And if it \add be\add* a female, then thy estimation shall be thirty shekels.
\p
\v 5 And if \add it be\add* from five years old even unto twenty years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male twenty shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\p
\v 6 And if \add it be\add* from a month old even unto five years old, then thy estimation shall be of the male five shekels of silver, and for the female thy estimation \add shall be\add* three shekels of silver.
\p
\v 7 And if \add it be\add* from sixty years old and above; if \add it be\add* a male, then thy estimation shall be fifteen shekels, and for the female ten shekels.
\p
\v 8 But if he be poorer than thy estimation, then he shall present himself before the priest, and the priest shall value him; according to his ability that vowed shall the priest value him.
\p
\v 9 And if \add it be\add* a beast, whereof men bring an offering unto the LORD, all that \add any man\add* giveth of such unto the LORD shall be holy.
\p
\v 10 He shall not alter it, nor change it, a good for a bad, or a bad for a good: and if he shall at all change beast for beast, then it and the exchange thereof shall be holy.
\p
\v 11 And if \add it be\add* any unclean beast, of which they do not offer a sacrifice unto the LORD, then he shall present the beast before the priest:
\p
\v 12 And the priest shall value it, whether it be good or bad: as thou valuest it, \add who art\add* the priest, so shall it be.
\p
\v 13 But if he will at all redeem it, then he shall add a fifth \add part\add* thereof unto thy estimation.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And when a man shall sanctify his house \add to be\add* holy unto the LORD, then the priest shall estimate it, whether it be good or bad: as the priest shall estimate it, so shall it stand.
\p
\v 15 And if he that sanctified it will redeem his house, then he shall add the fifth \add part\add* of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be his.
\p
\v 16 And if a man shall sanctify unto the LORD \add some part\add* of a field of his possession, then thy estimation shall be according to the seed thereof: an homer of barley seed \add shall be valued\add* at fifty shekels of silver.
\p
\v 17 If he sanctify his field from the year of jubilee, according to thy estimation it shall stand.
\p
\v 18 But if he sanctify his field after the jubilee, then the priest shall reckon unto him the money according to the years that remain, even unto the year of the jubilee, and it shall be abated from thy estimation.
\p
\v 19 And if he that sanctified the field will in any wise redeem it, then he shall add the fifth \add part\add* of the money of thy estimation unto it, and it shall be assured to him.
\p
\v 20 And if he will not redeem the field, or if he have sold the field to another man, it shall not be redeemed any more.
\p
\v 21 But the field, when it goeth out in the jubilee, shall be holy unto the LORD, as a field devoted; the possession thereof shall be the priest’s.
\p
\v 22 And if \add a man\add* sanctify unto the LORD a field which he hath bought, which \add is\add* not of the fields of his possession;
\p
\v 23 Then the priest shall reckon unto him the worth of thy estimation, \add even\add* unto the year of the jubilee: and he shall give thine estimation in that day, \add as\add* a holy thing unto the LORD.
\p
\v 24 In the year of the jubilee the field shall return unto him of whom it was bought, \add even\add* to him to whom the possession of the land \add did belong.\add*
\p
\v 25 And all thy estimations shall be according to the shekel of the sanctuary: twenty gerahs shall be the shekel.
\p
\v 26 ¶ Only the firstling of the beasts, which should be the LORD’S firstling, no man shall sanctify it; whether \add it be\add* ox, or sheep: it \add is\add* the LORD’S.
\p
\v 27 And if \add it be\add* of an unclean beast, then he shall redeem it according to thine estimation, and shall add a fifth \add part\add* of it thereto: or if it be not redeemed, then it shall be sold according to thy estimation.
\p
\v 28 Notwithstanding no devoted thing, that a man shall devote unto the LORD of all that he hath, \add both\add* of man and beast, and of the field of his possession, shall be sold or redeemed: every devoted thing \add is\add* most holy unto the LORD.
\p
\v 29 None devoted, which shall be devoted of men, shall be redeemed; \add but\add* shall surely be put to death.
\p
\v 30 And all the tithe of the land, \add whether\add* of the seed of the land, \add or\add* of the fruit of the tree, \add is\add* the LORD’S: \add it is\add* holy unto the LORD.
\p
\v 31 And if a man will at all redeem aught of his tithes, he shall add thereto the fifth \add part\add* thereof.
\p
\v 32 And concerning the tithe of the herd, or of the flock, \add even\add* of whatsoever passeth under the rod, the tenth shall be holy unto the LORD.
\p
\v 33 He shall not search whether it be good or bad, neither shall he change it: and if he change it at all, then both it and the change thereof shall be holy; it shall not be redeemed.
\p
\v 34 These \add are\add* the commandments, which the LORD commanded Moses for the children of Israel in mount Sinai.
