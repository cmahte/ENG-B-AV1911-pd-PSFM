\cl CHAPTER 1
\p
\v 1 ¶ The former narrative I made, O Theophilus, of all that Jesus began both to do and to teach,
\p
\v 2 Until the day in which he was taken up, after that he through the Holy Spirit had given commandments unto the apostles whom he had chosen:
\p
\v 3 To whom also he showed himself alive after his passion by many proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God:
\p
\v 4 And, being assembled together with \add them,\add* commanded them that they should not depart from Jerusalem, but wait for the promise of the Father, which, \add saith he,\add* ye have heard from me.
\p
\v 5 For John indeed baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit not many days hence.
\p
\v 6 When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel?
\p
\v 7 And he said unto them, It is not for you to know the times or the seasons, which the Father hath put in his own authority.
\p
\v 8 But ye shall receive power, after the Holy Spirit has come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judaea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.
\p
\v 9 And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight.
\p
\v 10 And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel;
\p
\v 11 Who also said, Ye men of Galilee, why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, who is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven.
\p
\v 12 Then returned they unto Jerusalem from the mount called Olivet, which is from Jerusalem a sabbath day’s journey.
\p
\v 13 And when they were come in, they went up into an upper room, where abode both Peter, and James, and John, and Andrew, Philip, and Thomas, Bartholomew, and Matthew, James \add the son\add* of Alphaeus, and Simon the Zealot, and Judas \add the brother\add* of James.
\p
\v 14 These all continued with one accord in prayer and supplication, with the women, and Mary the mother of Jesus, and with his brethren.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And in those days Peter stood up in the midst of the disciples, and said, (the number of names together were about an hundred and twenty,)
\p
\v 16 Men \add and\add* brethren, this scripture must needs have been fulfilled, which the Holy Spirit by the mouth of David spake before concerning Judas, who was guide to them that took Jesus.
\p
\v 17 For he was numbered with us, and had received a part in this ministry.
\p
\v 18 Now this man purchased a field with the reward of iniquity; and falling headlong, he burst asunder in the midst, and all his bowels gushed out.
\p
\v 19 And it became known unto all the dwellers at Jerusalem; insomuch as that field is called in their own tongue, Aceldama, that is, The field of blood.
\p
\v 20 For it is written in the book of Psalms, Let his habitation be desolate, and let no man dwell therein: and, His bishopric let another take.
\p
\v 21 Therefore, of these men that have accompanied us all the time that the Lord Jesus went in and out among us,
\p
\v 22 Beginning from the baptism of John, unto that same day that he was taken up from us, must one of these become a witness with us of his resurrection.
\p
\v 23 And they set forth two, Joseph called Barsabas, who was surnamed Justus, and Matthias.
\p
\v 24 And they prayed, and said, Thou, Lord, who knowest the hearts of all, show which of these two thou hast chosen,
\p
\v 25 That he may take the place in this ministry and apostleship, from which Judas by transgression fell, that he might go to his own place.
\p
\v 26 And they gave forth their lots; and the lot fell upon Matthias; and he was numbered with the eleven apostles.
\c 2
\cl CHAPTER 2
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when the day of Pentecost was fully come, they were all together in one place.
\p
\v 2 And suddenly there came a sound from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind, and it filled all the house where they were sitting.
\p
\v 3 And there appeared unto them tongues, as of fire, parting, and sitting upon each of them.
\p
\v 4 And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance.
\p
\v 5 Now there were dwelling at Jerusalem Jews, devout men, out of every nation under heaven.
\p
\v 6 And when this was noised abroad, the multitude came together, and were confounded, because that every man heard them speak in his own language.
\p
\v 7 And they were all amazed and marvelled, saying one to another, Behold, are not all these that speak Galilaeans?
\p
\v 8 And how hear we, every man in our own language wherein we were born?
\p
\v 9 Parthians, and Medes, and Elamites, and the dwellers in Mesopotamia, and in Judaea, and Cappadocia, in Pontus, and Asia,
\p
\v 10 Phrygia, and Pamphylia, in Egypt, and in the parts of Libya about Cyrene, and strangers from Rome, Jews and proselytes,
\p
\v 11 Cretes and Arabians, we do hear them speak in our languages the wonderful works of God.
\p
\v 12 And they were all amazed and perplexed, saying one to another, What meaneth this?
\p
\v 13 Others, mocking, said, These men are full of new wine.
\p
\v 14 ¶ But Peter, standing up with the eleven, lifted up his voice, and said unto them, Ye men of Judaea, and all \add ye\add* that dwell at Jerusalem, be this known unto you, and hearken to my words:
\p
\v 15 For these are not drunken, as ye suppose, seeing it is \add but\add* the third hour of the day.
\p
\v 16 But this is that which was spoken through the prophet Joel:
\p
\v 17 And it shall come to pass in the last days, saith God, I will pour out of my Spirit upon all flesh: and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams:
\p
\v 18 And on my servants and on my handmaidens I will pour out in those days of my Spirit; and they shall prophesy;
\p
\v 19 And I will show wonders in heaven above, and signs in the earth beneath; blood, and fire, and vapour of smoke:
\p
\v 20 The sun shall be turned into darkness, and the moon into blood, before that great and notable day of the Lord come:
\p
\v 21 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* whosoever shall call on the name of the Lord shall be saved.
\p
\v 22 Ye men of Israel, hear these words: Jesus of Nazareth, a man approved of God among you by miracles and wonders and signs, which God did by him in the midst of you, as ye yourselves also know:
\p
\v 23 Him, being delivered by the determinate counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and slain;
\p
\v 24 Whom God hath raised up, having loosed the pangs of death: because it was not possible that he should be held by it.
\p
\v 25 For David speaketh concerning him: I foresaw the Lord always before my face, for he is on my right hand, that I should not be moved:
\p
\v 26 Therefore did my heart rejoice, and my tongue was glad; moreover also my flesh shall rest in hope:
\p
\v 27 Because thou wilt not leave my soul in hell, neither wilt thou suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
\p
\v 28 Thou hast made known to me the ways of life; thou shalt make me full of joy with thy countenance.
\p
\v 29 Brethren, let me freely speak unto you of the patriarch David, that he is both dead and buried, and his sepulchre is with us unto this day.
\p
\v 30 Therefore being a prophet, and knowing that God had sworn with an oath to him, that of the fruit of his loins one should sit on his throne;
\p
\v 31 He seeing this before spake of the resurrection of Christ, that his soul was not left in hell, neither his flesh did see corruption.
\p
\v 32 This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses.
\p
\v 33 Therefore being by the right hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, he hath shed forth this, which ye now see and hear.
\p
\v 34 For David is not ascended into the heavens; but he saith himself, The LORD said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand,
\p
\v 35 Until I make thy foes thy footstool.
\p
\v 36 Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made this same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.
\p
\v 37 ¶ Now when they heard \add this,\add* they were pricked in their heart, and said unto Peter and to the rest of the apostles, Brethren, what shall we do?
\p
\v 38 Then Peter said unto them, Repent, and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ unto the remission of sins, and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 39 For the promise is unto you, and to your children, and to all that are afar off, as many as the Lord our God shall call.
\p
\v 40 And with many other words did he testify and exhort, saying, Save yourselves from this crooked generation.
\p
\v 41 ¶ Then they, having received his word, were baptized: and there were added in that day about three thousand souls.
\p
\v 42 And they continued stedfastly in the apostles’ teaching and fellowship, and in the breaking of bread, and in prayers.
\p
\v 43 And fear came upon every soul: and many wonders and signs were done by the apostles.
\p
\v 44 And all that believed were together, and had all things common;
\p
\v 45 And sold their possessions and goods, and parted them to all \add men,\add* as every man had need.
\p
\v 46 And they, continuing daily with one accord in the temple, and breaking bread from house to house, did eat their food with gladness and singleness of heart,
\p
\v 47 Praising God, and having favour with all the people. And the Lord added to them daily those who were being saved.
\c 3
\cl CHAPTER 3
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now Peter and John went up together into the temple at the hour of prayer, \add being\add* the ninth \add hour.\add* 
\p
\v 2 And a certain man lame from his mother’s womb was being carried, whom they laid daily at the gate of the temple which is called Beautiful, to ask alms of them that entered into the temple;
\p
\v 3 Who seeing Peter and John about to go into the temple asked an alms.
\p
\v 4 And Peter, fastening his eyes upon him with John, said, Look on us.
\p
\v 5 And he gave heed unto them, expecting to receive something from them.
\p
\v 6 Then Peter said, Silver and gold have I none; but such as I have give I thee: In the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth rise up and walk.
\p
\v 7 And he took him by the right hand, and lifted \add him\add* up: and immediately his feet and ankle bones received strength.
\p
\v 8 And he leaping up stood, and began to walk, and entered with them into the temple, walking, and leaping, and praising God.
\p
\v 9 And all the people saw him walking and praising God:
\p
\v 10 And they knew that it was he that sat for alms at the Beautiful gate of the temple: and they were filled with wonder and amazement at that which had happened unto him.
\p
\v 11 And as he held Peter and John, all the people ran together unto them in the porch that is called Solomon’s, greatly wondering.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And when Peter saw \add it,\add* he answered unto the people: Ye men of Israel, why marvel ye at this? or why look ye so earnestly on us, as though by our own power or godliness we had made this man to walk?
\p
\v 13 The God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob, the God of our fathers, hath glorified his Servant Jesus; whom ye delivered up, and denied in the presence of Pilate, when he was determined to let \add him\add* go.
\p
\v 14 But ye denied the Holy and Righteous One, and desired a murderer to be granted unto you;
\p
\v 15 And killed the Prince of Life, whom God hath raised from the dead; whereof we are witnesses.
\p
\v 16 And his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong, whom ye see and know: yea, the faith which is through him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all.
\p
\v 17 And now, brethren, I know that through ignorance ye did \add it,\add* as \add did\add* also your rulers.
\p
\v 18 But those things, which God had announced beforehand by the mouth of all his prophets, that his Christ should suffer, he hath so fulfilled.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Repent ye therefore, and turn again, that your sins may be blotted out, in order that the times of refreshing may come from the presence of the Lord;
\p
\v 20 And that he may send the Christ, who before was preached unto you:
\p
\v 21 Whom the heaven must receive until the times of the restitution of all things, of which God hath spoken by the mouth of all his holy prophets from old time.
\p
\v 22 For Moses truly said: A Prophet shall the Lord your God raise up unto you from among your brethren, like unto me; him shall ye hear in all things whatsoever he shall say unto you.
\p
\v 23 And it shall come to pass, \add that\add* every soul that will not hear that Prophet shall be utterly destroyed from among the people.
\p
\v 24 Yea, and all the prophets from Samuel and those that follow after, as many as have spoken, have likewise foretold these days.
\p
\v 25 Ye are the sons of the prophets, and of the covenant which God made with your fathers, saying unto Abraham, And in thy seed shall all the kindreds of the earth be blessed.
\p
\v 26 Unto you first God, having raised up his Servant, sent him to bless you, in turning away every one of you from your iniquities.
\c 4
\cl CHAPTER 4
\p
\v 1 ¶ And as they spake unto the people, the priests, and the captain of the temple, and the Sadducees, came upon them,
\p
\v 2 Being sore troubled because they taught the people, and preached through Jesus the resurrection from the dead.
\p
\v 3 And they laid hands on them, and put \add them\add* in prison unto the next day: for it was now eventide.
\p
\v 4 But many of them that heard the word believed; and the number of men became about five thousand.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And it came to pass on the morrow, that their rulers, and elders, and scribes,
\p
\v 6 And Annas the high priest, and Caiaphas, and John, and Alexander, and as many as were of the kindred of the high priest, were gathered together at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 7 And when they had set them in the midst, they asked, In what power, or in what name, have ye done this?
\p
\v 8 Then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit, said unto them: Ye rulers of the people, and elders,
\p
\v 9 If we this day be examined as to the good deed done to the impotent man, by what means he is made whole;
\p
\v 10 Be it known unto you all, and to all the people of Israel, that in the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom ye crucified, whom God raised from the dead, \add even\add* by him doth this man stand here before you whole.
\p
\v 11 This is the stone which was set at naught by you the builders, which became the head of the corner.
\p
\v 12 Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is no other name under heaven given among men, wherein we must be saved.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceived that they were unlearned and ignorant men, they marvelled; and they took knowledge of them, that they had been with Jesus.
\p
\v 14 And beholding the man that was healed standing with them, they could say nothing against it.
\p
\v 15 But when they had commanded them to go aside out of the council, they conferred among themselves,
\p
\v 16 Saying, What shall we do to these men? for that indeed a notable sign hath been done through them \add is\add* manifest to all them that dwell in Jerusalem; and we cannot deny \add it.\add* 
\p
\v 17 But that it spread no further among the people, let us threaten them, that they speak henceforth to no man in this name.
\p
\v 18 And they called them, and commanded them not to speak at all, nor teach, in the name of Jesus.
\p
\v 19 But Peter and John answered and said unto them: Whether it be right in the sight of God to hearken unto you more than unto God, judge ye:
\p
\v 20 For we cannot but speak the things which we have seen and heard.
\p
\v 21 So when they had further threatened them, they let them go, finding no way to punish them, because of the people: for all glorified God for what had been done.
\p
\v 22 For the man was above forty years old, on whom this miracle of healing had been wrought.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And being let go, they went to their own company, and reported all that the chief priests and elders had said unto them.
\p
\v 24 And when they heard that, they lifted up their voice to God with one accord, and said: Lord, thou \add art\add* God, who hast made the heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all that in them is:
\p
\v 25 Who through the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of thy servant David our father, hast said, Why did the nations rage, and the peoples imagine vain things?
\p
\v 26 The kings of the earth stood up, and the rulers were gathered together against the Lord, and against his Anointed.
\p
\v 27 For of a truth against thy holy Servant Jesus, whom thou hast anointed, both Herod, and Pontius Pilate, with the Gentiles, and the people of Israel, were gathered together in this city,
\p
\v 28 To do whatsoever thy hand and thy counsel predestinated to come to pass.
\p
\v 29 And now, Lord, behold their threatenings: and grant unto thy servants, that with all boldness they may speak thy word,
\p
\v 30 By stretching forth thy hand to heal; and that signs and wonders may be done by the name of thy holy Servant Jesus.
\p
\v 31 ¶ And when they had prayed, the place was shaken where they were assembled together, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spake the word of God with boldness.
\p
\v 32 And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and soul: and no one said that aught of the things which he possessed was his own; but they had all things common.
\p
\v 33 And with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus; and great grace was upon them all.
\p
\v 34 For there was no one among them that was in want: for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them, and brought the prices of the things that were sold,
\p
\v 35 And laid \add them\add* down at the apostles’ feet; and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need.
\p
\v 36 And Joseph, who by the apostles was surnamed Barnabas, (which is, being interpreted, The son of consolation,) a Levite, \add and\add* of the country of Cyprus,
\p
\v 37 Having land, sold \add it,\add* and brought the money, and laid \add it\add* at the apostles’ feet.
\c 5
\cl CHAPTER 5
\p
\v 1 ¶ But a certain man named Ananias, with Sapphira his wife, sold a possession,
\p
\v 2 And kept back \add part\add* of the price, his wife also being aware of \add it,\add* and brought a certain part, and laid \add it\add* at the apostles’ feet.
\p
\v 3 But Peter said, Ananias, why hath Satan filled thy heart to lie to the Holy Spirit, and to keep back \add part\add* of the price of the land?
\p
\v 4 While it remained, was it not thine own? and after it was sold, was it not in thine own power? why hast thou conceived this thing in thine heart? thou hast not lied unto men, but unto God.
\p
\v 5 And Ananias hearing these words fell down, and expired: and great fear came on all them that heard these things.
\p
\v 6 And the younger men arose, wound him up, and carried \add him\add* out, and buried \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 7 And it was about three hours after, when his wife, not knowing what had happened, came in.
\p
\v 8 And Peter said to her, Tell me whether ye sold the land for so much? And she said, Yea, for so much.
\p
\v 9 Then Peter said unto her, How is it that ye have agreed together to tempt the Spirit of the Lord? behold, the feet of them that have buried thy husband \add are\add* at the door, and they shall carry thee out.
\p
\v 10 Then fell she down straightway at his feet, and expired: and the young men came in, and found her dead, and, carrying \add her\add* forth, buried \add her\add* by her husband.
\p
\v 11 And great fear came upon all the church, and upon as many as heard these things.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And by the hands of the apostles were many signs and wonders wrought among the people; and they were all with one accord in Solomon’s porch.
\p
\v 13 And of the rest no one dared join them: but the people magnified them.
\p
\v 14 And believers were the more added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and women.
\p
\v 15 So that they brought forth the sick into the streets, and laid \add them\add* on beds and couches, that at least the shadow of Peter passing by might overshadow some of them.
\p
\v 16 There came also a multitude \add out\add* of the cities round about unto Jerusalem, bringing sick folks, and them that were vexed with unclean spirits: and they were healed every one.
\p
\v 17 ¶ Then the high priest rose up, and all they that were with him, which is the sect of the Sadducees, and were filled with jealousy,
\p
\v 18 And laid their hands on the apostles, and put them in the common prison.
\p
\v 19 But an angel of the Lord by night opened the prison doors, and brought them forth, and said,
\p
\v 20 Go, stand and speak in the temple to the people all the words of this Life.
\p
\v 21 And when they heard \add that,\add* they entered into the temple early in the morning, and taught. But the high priest came, and they that were with him, and called the council together, and all the senate of the children of Israel, and sent to the prison to have them brought.
\p
\v 22 But when the officers came, and found them not in the prison, they returned, and told,
\p
\v 23 Saying, The prison truly found we shut with all safety, and the keepers standing without before the doors: but when we had opened, we found no man within.
\p
\v 24 Now when the captain of the temple and the chief priests heard these things, they were sore perplexed concerning them, whereunto this would grow.
\p
\v 25 Then came one and told them, saying, Behold, the men whom ye put in prison are standing in the temple, and teaching the people.
\p
\v 26 Then went the captain with the officers, and brought them without violence: for they feared the people, lest they should have been stoned.
\p
\v 27 And when they had brought them, they set \add them\add* before the council. And the high priest asked them,
\p
\v 28 Saying, Did not we strictly command you that ye should not teach in this name? and, behold, ye have filled Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring this man’s blood upon us.
\p
\v 29 ¶ Then Peter and the \add other\add* apostles answered and said, We must obey God rather than men.
\p
\v 30 The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree.
\p
\v 31 Him hath God exalted by his right hand \add to be\add* a Prince and a Saviour, to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins.
\p
\v 32 And we are his witnesses as to these things; and \add so is\add* also the Holy Spirit, whom God hath given to them that obey him.
\p
\v 33 ¶ When they heard \add that,\add* they were torn \add with rage,\add* and took counsel to slay them.
\p
\v 34 Then there stood up one in the council, a Pharisee, named Gamaliel, a teacher of the law, honoured by all the people, and commanded to put the apostles forth a little while,
\p
\v 35 And said unto them: Ye men of Israel, take heed to yourselves what ye intend to do as touching these men.
\p
\v 36 For before these days rose up Theudas, claiming to be somebody; to whom a number of men, about four hundred, joined themselves: who was slain; and all, as many as obeyed him, were scattered, and brought to nothing.
\p
\v 37 After this man rose up Judas of Galilee in the days of the taxing, and drew away many people after him: he also perished; and all, \add even\add* as many as obeyed him, were dispersed.
\p
\v 38 And now I say unto you, Refrain from these men, and let them alone: for if this counsel or this work be of men, it will come to nothing.
\p
\v 39 But if it be of God, ye cannot overthrow it; lest haply ye be found even to fight against God.
\p
\v 40 And to him they agreed: and when they had called the apostles, and beaten \add them,\add* they commanded that they should not speak in the name of Jesus, and let them go.
\p
\v 41 ¶ And they departed from the presence of the council, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonour for the Name.
\p
\v 42 And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus as the Christ.
\c 6
\cl CHAPTER 6
\p
\v 1 ¶ And in those days, when the number of the disciples was multiplying, there arose a murmuring of the Grecian Jews against the Hebrews, because their widows were neglected in the daily ministration.
\p
\v 2 Then the twelve called the multitude of the disciples \add unto them,\add* and said: It is not befitting that we should leave the word of God, and serve tables.
\p
\v 3 Wherefore, brethren, look ye out among you seven men of honest report, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we may appoint over this business.
\p
\v 4 But we will give ourselves continually to prayer, and to the ministry of the word.
\p
\v 5 ¶ And the saying pleased the whole multitude: and they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas a proselyte of Antioch:
\p
\v 6 Whom they set before the apostles: and when they had prayed, they laid \add their\add* hands on them.
\p
\v 7 And the word of God increased; and the number of the disciples multiplied in Jerusalem greatly; and a great company of the priests were obedient to the faith.
\p
\v 8 And Stephen, full of grace and power, did great wonders and miracles among the people.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Then there arose certain of \add the synagogue,\add* which is called the synagogue of the Libertines, and Cyrenians, and Alexandrians, and those from Cilicia and Asia, disputing with Stephen.
\p
\v 10 And they were not able to resist the wisdom and the Spirit by which he spake.
\p
\v 11 Then they suborned men, who said: We have heard him speak blasphemous words against Moses, and God.
\p
\v 12 And they stirred up the people, and the elders, and the scribes, and came upon \add him,\add* and caught him, and brought \add him\add* to the council,
\p
\v 13 And set up false witnesses, who said: This man ceaseth not to speak blasphemous words against this holy place, and the law:
\p
\v 14 For we have heard him say, that this Jesus of Nazareth shall destroy this place, and shall change the customs which Moses delivered us.
\p
\v 15 And all that sat in the council, looking stedfastly on him, saw his face as the face of an angel.
\c 7
\cl CHAPTER 7
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then said the high priest, Are these things so?
\p
\v 2 And he said: Brethren and fathers, hearken; The God of glory appeared unto our father Abraham, when he was in Mesopotamia, before he dwelt in Haran,
\p
\v 3 And said unto him, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and come into the land which I shall show thee.
\p
\v 4 Then came he out of the land of the Chaldasans, and dwelt in Haran: and from thence, when his father was dead, he removed him into this land, wherein ye now dwell.
\p
\v 5 And he gave him no inheritance in it, no, not \add so much as\add* to set his foot on; yet he promised that he would give it to him for a possession, and to his seed after him, when \add as yet\add* he had no child.
\p
\v 6 And God spake on this wise, That his seed should sojourn in a strange land; and that they should bring them into bondage, and afflict them four hundred years.
\p
\v 7 And the nation to which they shall be in bondage will I judge, said God: and after that shall they come forth, and serve me in this place.
\p
\v 8 And he gave him the covenant of circumcision: and so \add Abraham\add* begat Isaac, and circumcised him the eighth day; and Isaac \add begat\add* Jacob; and Jacob \add begat\add* the twelve patriarchs.
\p
\v 9 And the patriarchs, moved with envy, sold Joseph into Egypt: but God was with him,
\p
\v 10 And delivered him out of all his afflictions, and gave him favour and wisdom in the sight of Pharaoh king of Egypt, and he made him governor over Egypt and all his house.
\p
\v 11 Now there came a famine over all the land of Egypt and Canaan, and great affliction: and our fathers found no sustenance.
\p
\v 12 But when Jacob heard that there was grain in Egypt, he sent out our fathers first.
\p
\v 13 And at the second \add time\add* Joseph was made known to his brethren; and Joseph’s kindred was made known unto Pharaoh.
\p
\v 14 Then sent Joseph, and called his father Jacob to \add him,\add* and all his kindred, threescore and fifteen souls.
\p
\v 15 So Jacob went down into Egypt, and died, he, and our fathers,
\p
\v 16 And were carried over unto Shechem, and laid in the sepulchre that Abraham bought for a sum of money of the sons of Hamor, in Shechem.
\p
\v 17 But when the time of the promise drew nigh, which God had sworn to Abraham, the people grew and multiplied in Egypt,
\p
\v 18 Till another king arose, who knew not Joseph.
\p
\v 19 The same dealt subtly with our kindred, and oppressed our fathers, that they should cast out their young children, to the end that they might not live.
\p
\v 20 In which time Moses was born, and was exceeding fair, and nourished in his father’s house three months;
\p
\v 21 And when he was cast out, Pharaoh’s daughter took him up, and nourished him as her own son.
\p
\v 22 And Moses was learned in all the wisdom of the Egyptians, and was mighty in words and in deeds.
\p
\v 23 And when he was about forty years old, it came into his heart to visit his brethren the children of Israel.
\p
\v 24 And seeing one \add of them\add* suffer wrong, he defended \add him,\add* and avenged him that was oppressed, and smote the Egyptian:
\p
\v 25 For he supposed his brethren would have understood how that God by his hand would deliver them: but they understood not.
\p
\v 26 And the next day he showed himself unto them as they strove, and urged them to peace, saying. Sirs, ye are brethren; why do ye wrong one to another?
\p
\v 27 But he that did his neighbour wrong thrust him away, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge over us?
\p
\v 28 Wilt thou kill me, as thou killedst the Egyptian yesterday?
\p
\v 29 And Moses fled at this saying, and was a stranger in the land of Midian, where he begat two sons.
\p
\v 30 And when forty years were expired, there appeared to him in the wilderness of mount Sinai an angel in a flame of fire in a bush.
\p
\v 31 When Moses saw \add it,\add* he wondered at the sight; and as he drew near to behold \add it,\add* the voice of the Lord came unto him,
\p
\v 32 \add Saying,\add* I \add am\add* the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, and of Isaac, and of Jacob. Then Moses trembled, and dared not look.
\p
\v 33 Then said the Lord to him, Put off thy shoes from thy feet: for the place where thou standest is holy ground.
\p
\v 34 I have seen, I have seen the affliction of my people that are in Egypt, and I have heard their groaning, and am come down to deliver them. And now come, I will send thee into Egypt.
\p
\v 35 This Moses whom they refused, saying, Who made thee a ruler and a judge? the same did God send \add to be\add* a ruler and a deliverer by the hand of the angel that appeared to him in the bush.
\p
\v 36 He brought them out, after that he had showed wonders and signs in the land of Egypt, and in the Red Sea, and in the wilderness forty years.
\p
\v 37 ¶ This is that Moses, who said unto the children of Israel, A prophet shall your God raise up unto you of your brethren, like unto me.
\p
\v 38 This is he that was in the assembly in the wilderness with the angel that spake to him in the mount Sinai, and \add with\add* our fathers: who received the living oracles to give unto us:
\p
\v 39 Whom our fathers would not obey, but thrust him from them, and in their hearts turned back again into Egypt,
\p
\v 40 Saying unto Aaron, Make us gods to go before us: for \add as for\add* this Moses, who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we know not what is become of him.
\p
\v 41 And they made a calf in those days, and offered sacrifice unto the idol, and rejoiced in the works of their own hands.
\p
\v 42 Then God turned, and gave them up to worship the host of heaven; as it is written in the book of the prophets, O ye house of Israel, have ye offered to me slain beasts and sacrifices \add by the space of\add* forty years in the wilderness?
\p
\v 43 Yea, ye took up the tabernacle of Moloch, and the star of the god Rephan, figures which ye made to worship them: and I will carry you away beyond Babylon.
\p
\v 44 Our fathers had the tabernacle of witness in the wilderness, as he had appointed, speaking unto Moses, that he should make it according to the fashion that he had seen.
\p
\v 45 Which also our fathers that came after brought in with Joshua into the possession of the Gentiles, whom God drove out before the face of our fathers, unto the days of David;
\p
\v 46 Who obtained favour before God, and desired to obtain a dwelling-place for the God of Jacob.
\p
\v 47 But Solomon built him a house.
\p
\v 48 Howbeit the most High dwelleth not in temples made with hands; as saith the prophet,
\p
\v 49 Heaven \add is\add* my throne, and earth \add is\add* my footstool: what house will ye build me? saith the Lord: or what \add is\add* the place of my rest?
\p
\v 50 Hath not my hand made all these things?
\p
\v 51 ¶ Ye stiffnecked and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do always resist the Holy Spirit: as your fathers \add did,\add* so \add do\add* ye.
\p
\v 52 Which of the prophets have not your fathers persecuted? and they have slain them that announced beforehand concerning the coming of the Righteous One; of whom ye have been now the betrayers and murderers:
\p
\v 53 Who have received the law by the disposition of angels, and have not kept \add it\add*.
\p
\v 54 ¶ When they heard these things, they were cut to the heart, and they gnashed their teeth against him.
\p
\v 55 But he, being full of the Holy Spirit, looked up stedfastly into heaven, and saw the glory of God, and Jesus standing on the right hand of God,
\p
\v 56 And said, Behold, I see the heavens opened, and the Son of man standing on the right hand of God.
\p
\v 57 Then they cried out with a loud voice, and stopped their ears, and ran upon him with one accord,
\p
\v 58 And cast \add him\add* out of the city, and stoned \add him:\add* and the witnesses laid down their clothes at a young man’s feet, whose name was Saul.
\p
\v 59 And they stoned Stephen, as he was praying, and saying, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit.
\p
\v 60 And he kneeled down, and cried with a loud voice. Lord, lay not this sin to their charge. And when he had said this, he fell asleep.
\c 8
\cl CHAPTER 8
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Saul was consenting unto his death. And at that time there was a great persecution against the church which was at Jerusalem; and they were all scattered abroad throughout the regions of Judaea and Samaria, except the apostles.
\p
\v 2 And devout men carried Stephen \add to his burial,\add* and made great lamentation over him.
\p
\v 3 As for Saul, he made havoc of the church, entering into house after house, and dragging away men and women, committed \add them\add* to prison.
\p
\v 4 Therefore they that were scattered abroad went every where preaching the word.
\p
\v 5 Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria, and preached Christ unto them.
\p
\v 6 And the people with one accord gave heed unto those things which Philip spake, hearing and seeing the miracles which he did.
\p
\v 7 For unclean spirits, crying with loud voice, came out of many that were possessed \add with them:\add* and many taken with palsies, and that were lame, were healed.
\p
\v 8 And there was great joy in that city.
\p
\v 9 But there was a certain man, called Simon, who beforetime in the same city used sorcery, and astonished the people of Samaria, giving out that himself was some great one:
\p
\v 10 To whom they all gave heed, from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God.
\p
\v 11 And to him they had regard, because that of long time he had astonished them with sorceries.
\p
\v 12 But when they believed Philip preaching the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized, both men and women.
\p
\v 13 Then Simon himself believed also: and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and wondered, beholding the miracles and signs which were done.
\p
\v 14 Now when the apostles who were at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent unto them Peter and John:
\p
\v 15 Who, when they were come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit;
\p
\v 16 For he had not yet fallen upon any of them: only they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 17 Then laid they \add their\add* hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 18 And when Simon saw that through the laying on of the apostles’ hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money,
\p
\v 19 Saying, Give me also this power, that on whomsoever I lay hands, he may receive the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 20 But Peter said unto him, Thy money perish with thee, because thou hast thought that the gift of God may be purchased with money.
\p
\v 21 Thou hast neither part nor lot in this matter: for thy heart is not right in the sight of God.
\p
\v 22 Repent therefore of this thy wickedness, and pray the Lord, if perhaps the thought of thy heart may be forgiven thee.
\p
\v 23 For I perceive that thou art in the gall of bitterness, and \add in\add* the bond of iniquity.
\p
\v 24 Then answered Simon, and said, Pray ye to the Lord for me, that none of these things which ye have spoken come upon me.
\p
\v 25 And they, when they had testified and preached the word of the Lord, returned to Jerusalem, and preached the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans.
\p
\v 26 But an angel of the Lord spake unto Philip, saying, Arise, and go toward the south unto the way that goeth down from Jerusalem unto Gaza, which is desert.
\p
\v 27 And he arose and went: and, behold, a man of Ethiopia, an eunuch of great authority under Candace queen of the Ethiopians, who had the charge of all her treasure, and had come to Jerusalem to worship,
\p
\v 28 Was returning, and sitting in his chariot read Isaiah the prophet.
\p
\v 29 Then the Spirit said unto Philip, Go near, and join thyself to this chariot.
\p
\v 30 And Philip ran thither to \add him,\add* and heard him read the prophet Isaiah, and said, Understandest thou what thou readest?
\p
\v 31 And he said, How can I, except some one should guide me? And he besought Philip that he would come up and sit with him.
\p
\v 32 The place of the scripture which he read was this, He was led as a sheep to the slaughter; and like a lamb dumb before his shearer, so opened he not his mouth:
\p
\v 33 In his humiliation his judgment was taken away: and who shall declare his generation? for his life is taken from the earth.
\p
\v 34 And the eunuch answered Philip, and said, I pray thee, of whom speaketh the prophet this? of himself, or of some other man?
\p
\v 35 Then Philip opened his mouth, and began at the same scripture, and preached unto him Jesus.
\p
\v 36 And as they went on \add their\add* way, they came unto a certain water: and the eunuch said, See, \add here is\add* water; what doth hinder me to be baptized?
\p
\v 38 And he commanded the chariot to stand still: and they went down both into the water, both Philip and the eunuch; and he baptized him.
\p
\v 39 And when they were come up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught away Philip, that the eunuch saw him no more; and he went on his way rejoicing.
\p
\v 40 But Philip was found at Azotus: and passing through he preached the gospel to all the cities, till he came to Caesarea.
\c 9
\cl CHAPTER 9
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Saul, yet breathing out threatenings and slaughter against the disciples of the Lord, went unto the high priest,
\p
\v 2 And desired of him letters to Damascus to the synagogues, that if he found any that were of the Way, whether they were men or women, he might bring them bound unto Jerusalem.
\p
\v 3 And as he journeyed, he came near Damascus: and suddenly there shone round about him a light from heaven:
\p
\v 4 And he fell to the earth, and heard a voice saying unto him, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
\p
\v 5 And he said, Who art thou, Lord? And he said, I am Jesus whom thou persecutest.
\p
\v 6 But arise, and go into the city, and it shall be told thee what thou must do.
\p
\v 7 And the men who journeyed with him stood speechless, hearing the voice, but seeing no man.
\p
\v 8 And Saul arose from the earth; and when his eyes were opened, he saw no man: but they led him by the hand, and brought \add him\add* into Damascus.
\p
\v 9 And he was three days without sight, and neither did eat nor drink.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And there was a certain disciple at Damascus, named Ananias; and to him said the Lord in a vision, Ananias. And he said, Behold, I \add am here,\add* Lord.
\p
\v 11 And the Lord \add said\add* unto him, Arise, and go into the street which is called Straight, and inquire in the house of Judas for \add one\add* called Saul, of Tarsus: for, behold, he prayeth,
\p
\v 12 And hath seen in a vision a man named Ananias coming in, and putting \add his\add* hand on him, that he might receive his sight.
\p
\v 13 Then Ananias answered, Lord, I have heard by many of this man, how much evil he hath done to thy saints at Jerusalem:
\p
\v 14 And here he hath authority from the chief priests to bind all that call on thy name.
\p
\v 15 But the Lord said unto him, Go thy way: for he is a chosen vessel unto me, to bear my name before Gentiles, and kings, and the children of Israel:
\p
\v 16 For I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name’s sake.
\p
\v 17 And Ananias went his way, and entered into the house; and putting his hands on him said, Brother Saul, the Lord, \add even\add* Jesus, who appeared unto thee in the way as thou camest, hath sent me, that thou mightest receive thy sight, and be filled with the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 18 And immediately there fell from his eyes as it were scales: and he received sight forthwith, and arose, and was baptized.
\p
\v 19 And when he had received food, he was strengthened. Then was Saul certain days with the disciples that were at Damascus.
\p
\v 20 And straightway, in the synagogues, he proclaimed Jesus, that he is the Son of God.
\p
\v 21 But all that heard \add him\add* were amazed, and said; Is not this he that destroyed them that called on this name in Jerusalem, and came hither for this purpose, that he might bring them bound unto the chief priests?
\p
\v 22 But Saul increased the more in strength, and confounded the Jews that dwelt at Damascus, proving that this is the very Christ.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And when many days were fulfilled, the Jews took counsel to kill him:
\p
\v 24 But their plot became known to Saul. And they watched the gates day and night to kill him.
\p
\v 25 But the disciples took him by night, and let \add him\add* down through the wall in a basket.
\p
\v 26 And coming to Jerusalem, he essayed to join himself to the disciples: but they were all afraid of him, and believed not that he was a disciple.
\p
\v 27 But Barnabas took him, and brought \add him\add* to the apostles, and declared unto them how he had seen the Lord in the way, and that he had spoken to him, and how he had preached boldly at Damascus in the name of Jesus.
\p
\v 28 And he was with them coming in and going out at Jerusalem.
\p
\v 29 And he spake boldly in the name of the Lord, and disputed against the Grecian Jews; but they sought to slay him.
\p
\v 30 \add Which\add* when the brethren knew, they brought him down to Caesarea, and sent him forth to Tarsus.
\p
\v 31 Then had the churches rest throughout all Judaea and Galilee and Samaria, and were edified; and walking in the fear of the Lord, and in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, were multiplied.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And it came to pass, as Peter passed throughout all \add quarters,\add* he came down also to the saints that dwelt at Lydda.
\p
\v 33 And there he found a certain man named Aeneas, who had kept his bed eight years, and was paralyzed.
\p
\v 34 And Peter said unto him, Aeneas, Jesus, the Christ, maketh thee whole: arise, and make thy bed. And he arose immediately.
\p
\v 35 And all that dwelt at Lydda and Sharon saw him, and turned to the Lord.
\p
\v 36 Now there was at Joppa a certain disciple named Tabitha, which by interpretation is called Dorcas: this woman was full of good works and almsdeeds which she did.
\p
\v 37 And it came to pass in those days, that she was sick, and died: whom when they had washed, they laid in an upper chamber.
\p
\v 38 And forasmuch as Lydda was nigh to Joppa, and the; disciples had heard that Peter was there, they sent unto him two men, desiring \add him\add* that he would not delay to come to them.
\p
\v 39 Then Peter arose and went with them. When he was come, they brought him into the upper chamber: and all the widows stood by him weeping, and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas made, while she was with them.
\p
\v 40 But Peter put them all forth, and kneeled down, and prayed; and turning to the body, he said, Tabitha, arise. And she opened her eyes: and when she saw Peter, she sat up.
\p
\v 41 And he gave her \add his\add* hand, and lifted her up, and when he had called the saints and widows, presented her alive.
\p
\v 42 And it came to be known throughout all Joppa; and many believed on the Lord.
\p
\v 43 And it came to pass, that he tarried many days in Joppa with one Simon a tanner.
\c 10
\cl CHAPTER 10
\p
\v 1 ¶ There was a certain man in Caesarea called Cornelius, a centurion of the band called the Italian \add band,\add* 
\p
\v 2 A devout \add man,\add* and one that feared God with all his house, who gave much alms to the people, and prayed to God alway.
\p
\v 3 He saw in a vision clearly, about the ninth hour of the day, an angel of God coming in to him, and saying unto him, Cornelius.
\p
\v 4 And when he looked on him, he was afraid, and said, What is it, Lord? And he said unto him, Thy prayers and thine alms are gone up for a memorial before God.
\p
\v 5 And now send men to Joppa, and call for \add one\add* Simon, whose surname is Peter:
\p
\v 6 He lodgeth with one Simon a tanner, whose house is by the sea side.
\p
\v 7 And when the angel that spake unto Cornelius was departed, he called two of his household servants, and a devout soldier of them that waited on him continually;
\p
\v 8 And when he had declared all \add these\add* things unto them, he sent them to Joppa.
\p
\v 9 ¶ On the morrow, as they went on their journey, and drew nigh unto the city, Peter went up upon the housetop to pray about the sixth hour:
\p
\v 10 And he became very hungry, and would have eaten: but while they made ready, he fell into a trance,
\p
\v 11 And saw heaven opened, and a certain vessel descending, like a great sheet knit at the four corners, and let down to the earth:
\p
\v 12 Wherein were all manner of fourfooted beasts of the earth, and creeping things, and fowls of the air.
\p
\v 13 And there came a voice to him, Rise, Peter; kill, and eat.
\p
\v 14 But Peter said, Not so, Lord; for I have never eaten any thing that is common or unclean.
\p
\v 15 And the voice \add spake\add* unto him again the second time, What God hath cleansed, \add that\add* call not thou common.
\p
\v 16 This was done thrice: and the vessel was received up again into heaven.
\p
\v 17 Now while Peter was much perplexed in himself what this vision which he had seen might mean, behold, the men that were sent from Cornelius had made inquiry for Simon’s house, and stood before the gate,
\p
\v 18 And called, and asked whether Simon, who was surnamed Peter, lodged there.
\p
\v 19 ¶ While Peter thought on the vision, the Spirit said unto him, Behold, three men seek thee.
\p
\v 20 Arise therefore, and get thee down, and go with them, doubting nothing: for I have sent them.
\p
\v 21 Then Peter went down to the men, and said, Behold, I am he whom ye seek: what \add is\add* the cause wherefore ye are come?
\p
\v 22 And they said, Cornelius the centurion, a righteous man, and one that feareth God, and of good report among all the nation of the Jews, was warned from God by a holy angel to send for thee into his house, and to hear words of thee.
\p
\v 23 Then he called them in, and lodged \add them.\add* And on the morrow Peter went away with them, and certain brethren from Joppa accompanied him.
\p
\v 24 And the morrow after they entered into Caesarea. And Cornelius was waiting for them, and had called together his kinsmen and near friends
\p
\v 25 And as Peter was coming in, Cornelius met him, and fell down at his feet, and worshipped \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 26 But Peter took him up, saying, Stand up; I myself also am a man.
\p
\v 27 And as he talked with him, he went in, and found many that were come together.
\p
\v 28 And he said unto them, Ye know how that it is an unlawful thing for a man that is a Jew to keep company, or come unto one of another nation; but God hath showed me that I should not call any man common or unclean.
\p
\v 29 Therefore came I \add unto you\add* without gainsaying, as soon as I was sent for: I ask therefore for what intent ye have sent for me?
\p
\v 30 And Cornelius said, Four days ago, at the ninth hour, I was praying in my house, and, behold, a man stood before me in bright clothing,
\p
\v 31 And said, Cornelius, thy prayer is heard, and thine alms are had in remembrance in the sight of God.
\p
\v 32 Send therefore to Joppa, and call hither Simon, whose surname is Peter; he is lodging in the house of Simon a tanner by the sea side.
\p
\v 33 Immediately therefore I sent to thee; and thou hast well done that thou art come. Now therefore are we all here present before God, to hear all things that are commanded thee of the Lord.
\p
\v 34 ¶ Then Peter opened \add his\add* mouth, and said: Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons;
\p
\v 35 But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him,
\p
\v 36 The word which \add God\add* sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ; (he is Lord of all;)
\p
\v 37 That word, \add I say,\add* ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;
\p
\v 38 How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Spirit and with power; who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.
\p
\v 39 And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:
\p
\v 40 Him God raised up the third day, and showed him openly;
\p
\v 41 Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, \add even\add* to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.
\p
\v 42 And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he who hath been ordained of God \add to be\add* the Judge of living and dead.
\p
\v 43 To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth on him shall receive remission of sins.
\p
\v 44 ¶ While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Spirit fell on all them that heard the word.
\p
\v 45 And they of the circumcision that believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was ooured out the gift of the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 46 For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,
\p
\v 47 Can any man forbid the water, that these should not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit as well as we?
\p
\v 48 And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. Then they besought him to tarry certain days.
\c 11
\cl CHAPTER 11
\p
\v 1 ¶ And the apostles and brethren that were in Judaea heard that the Gentiles had also received the word of God.
\p
\v 2 And when Peter was come up to Jerusalem, they that were of the circumcision contended with him,
\p
\v 3 Saying, Thou wentest in to men uncircumcised, and didst eat with them.
\p
\v 4 But Peter rehearsed \add the matter\add* from the beginning, and expounded \add it\add* in order unto them, saying:
\p
\v 5 I was in the city of Joppa praying: and in a trance I saw a vision, a certain vessel descending, like a great sheet, let down from heaven by four corners; and it came even to me:
\p
\v 6 Upon which, when I had fastened my eyes, I considered, and saw fourfooted beasts of the earth, and wild beasts, and creeping things, and birds of the air.
\p
\v 7 And also I heard a voice saying unto me, Arise, Peter; slay and eat.
\p
\v 8 But I said, Not so, Lord: for nothing common or unclean hath at any time entered into my mouth.
\p
\v 9 But the voice answered me again from heaven, What God hath cleansed, \add that\add* call not thou common.
\p
\v 10 And this was done three times: and all were drawn up again into heaven.
\p
\v 11 And, behold, immediately three men were at the house where I was, sent from Caesarea unto me.
\p
\v 12 And the Spirit bade me go with them, nothing doubting. Moreover these six brethren accompanied me, and we entered into the man’s house:
\p
\v 13 And he showed us how he had seen an angel in his house, who stood and said. Send to Joppa, and call for Simon, whose surname is Peter;
\p
\v 14 Who shall tell thee words, whereby thou and all thy house shalt be saved.
\p
\v 15 And as I began to speak, the Holy Spirit fell on them, even as on us at the beginning.
\p
\v 16 Then remembered I the word of the Lord, how that he said, John baptized with water; but ye shall be baptized with the Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 17 Forasmuch then as God gave unto them the same gift as unto us, who believed on the Lord Jesus Christ, who was I, that I could withstand God?
\p
\v 18 When they heard these things, they held their peace, and glorified God, saying, Then hath God also to the Gentiles granted repentance unto life.
\p
\v 19 ¶ Now they that were scattered abroad upon the persecution that arose about Stephen travelled as far as Phoenicia and Cyprus and Antioch, preaching the word to none but unto the Jews only.
\p
\v 20 And some of them were men of Cyprus and Cyrene, who, when they were come to Antioch, spake unto the Greeks, preaching the gospel of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 21 And the hand of the Lord was with them: and a great number believed, and turned unto the Lord.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then tidings of these things came unto the ears of the church which was in Jerusalem: and they sent forth; Barnabas, that he should go as far as Antioch.
\p
\v 23 Who, when he came, and had seen the grace of God, was glad, and exhorted them all, that with purpose of heart they would cleave unto the Lord.
\p
\v 24 For he was a good man, and full of the Holy Spirit and of faith: and many people were added unto the Lord.
\p
\v 25 Then he went to Tarsus, to seek for Saul;
\p
\v 26 And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that for a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught a great multitude. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And in these days came prophets from Jerusalem unto Antioch.
\p
\v 28 And there stood up one of them named Agabus, and signified by the Spirit that there should be great famine over all the inhabited earth; which came to pass in the days of Claudius.
\p
\v 29 Then the disciples, every man according to his ability, determined to send relief unto the brethren that dwelt in Judaea:
\p
\v 30 Which also they did, and sent it to the elders by the hands of Barnabas and Saul.
\c 12
\cl CHAPTER 12
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now about that time Herod the king stretched forth \add his\add* hands to hurt some of those of the church.
\p
\v 2 And he killed James the brother of John with the sword.
\p
\v 3 And because he saw it pleased the Jews, he proceeded further to take Peter also. (Then were the days of unleavened bread.)
\p
\v 4 And when he had seized him, he put \add him\add* in prison, and delivered \add him\add* to four quaternions of soldiers to keep him; intending after the Passover to bring him forth to the people.
\p
\v 5 Peter therefore was kept in prison; but instant and earnest prayer was made by the church unto God for him.
\p
\v 6 And when Herod would have brought him forth, the same night Peter was sleeping between two soldiers, bound with two chains: and the keepers before the door kept the prison.
\p
\v 7 And, behold, an angel of the Lord stood over \add him,\add* and a light shone in the prison: and he smote Peter on the side, and awakened him, saying, Rise up quickly. And his chains fell off \add his\add* hands.
\p
\v 8 And the angel said unto him, Gird thyself, and bind on thy sandals. And so he did. And he saith unto him, Cast thy garment about thee, and follow me.
\p
\v 9 And he went out, and followed him; and knew not that it was true which was done by the angel; but thought he saw a vision.
\p
\v 10 When they were past the first and the second watch, they came unto the iron gate that leadeth unto the city; which opened to them of its own accord: and they went out, and passed on through one street; and forthwith the angel departed from him.
\p
\v 11 And when Peter had come to himself, he said, Now I know of a surety, that the Lord hath sent his angel, and hath delivered me out of the hand of Herod, and \add from\add* all the expectation of the people of the Jews.
\p
\v 12 And when he had considered \add the thing,\add* he came to the house of Mary the mother of John, whose surname was Mark; where many were gathered together praying
\p
\v 13 And as Peter knocked at the door of the gate, a maidservant came to answer, named Rhoda.
\p
\v 14 And when she knew Peter’s voice, she opened not the gate for gladness, but ran in, and told how Peter stood before the gate.
\p
\v 15 And they said unto her, Thou art mad. But she constantly affirmed that it was even so. Then said they, It is his angel.
\p
\v 16 But Peter continued knocking: and when they had opened \add the door,\add* and saw him, they were astonished.
\p
\v 17 But he, beckoning unto them with the hand to hold their peace, declared unto them how the Lord had brought him out of the prison. And he said, Go tell these things unto James, and to the brethren. And he departed, and went into another place.
\p
\v 18 Now as soon as it was day, there was no small stir among the soldiers, what had become of Peter.
\p
\v 19 And when Herod had sought for him, and found him not, he examined the keepers, and commanded that \add they\add* should be led away to death. And he went down from Judaea to Caesarea, and \add there\add* abode.
\p
\v 20 ¶ And he was highly displeased with them of Tyre and Sidon: but they came with one accord to him, and, having made Blastus, who was over the king’s bed-chamber, their friend, desired peace; because their country was nourished by the king’s \add country.\add* 
\p
\v 21 And upon a set day Herod, arrayed in royal apparel, sat upon his throne, and made an oration unto them.
\p
\v 22 And the people shouted. The voice of a god, and not of a man!
\p
\v 23 And immediately an angel of the Lord smote him, because he gave not God the glory: and he was eaten by worms, and expired.
\p
\v 24 ¶ But the word of God grew and multiplied.
\p
\v 25 And Barnabas and Saul returned from Jerusalem, when they had completed \add their\add* mission, and took with them John, whose surname was Mark.
\c 13
\cl CHAPTER 13
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now there were in the church that was at Antioch, prophets and teachers: Barnabas, and Simeon that was called Niger, and Lucius of Cyrene, and Manaen, the foster-brother of Herod the tetrarch, and Saul.
\p
\v 2 As they ministered to the Lord, and fasted, the Holy Spirit said, Separate me Barnabas and Saul for the work whereunto I have called them.
\p
\v 3 And when they had fasted and prayed, and laid \add their\add* hands on them, they sent \add them\add* away.
\p
\v 4 ¶ So they, being sent forth by the Holy Spirit, went down to Seleucia; and from thence they sailed to Cyprus.
\p
\v 5 And when they were at Salamis, they preached the word of God in the synagogues of the Jews: and they had also John as \add their\add* attendant.
\p
\v 6 And when they had gone through the isle unto Paphos, they found a certain sorcerer, a false prophet, a Jew, whose name \add was\add* Bar-jesus:
\p
\v 7 Who was with the proconsul of the country, Sergius Paulus, an intelligent man; who called for Barnabas and Saul, and desired to hear the word of God.
\p
\v 8 But Elymas the sorcerer (for so is his name by interpretation) withstood them, seeking to turn away the proconsul from the faith.
\p
\v 9 Then Saul, (who also \add is called\add* Paul,) filled with the Holy Spirit, set his eyes on him,
\p
\v 10 And said, O full of all deceit and all villainy, \add thou\add* son of the devil, \add thou\add* enemy of all righteousness, wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord?
\p
\v 11 And now, behold, the hand of the Lord \add is\add* upon thee, and thou shalt be blind, not seeing the sun for a season. And immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness; and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand.
\p
\v 12 Then the proconsul, when he saw what was done, believed, being astonished at the teaching of the Lord.
\p
\v 13 Now Paul and his company, having sailed from Paphos, came to Perga in Pamphylia; and John, departing from them, returned to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 14 ¶ But having departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, and sat down.
\p
\v 15 And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Brethren, if ye have any word of exhortation for the people, say on.
\p
\v 16 Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with \add his\add* hand said: Men of Israel, and ye that fear God, give audience.
\p
\v 17 The God of this people of Israel chose our fathers, and exalted the people when they dwelt as strangers in the land of Egypt, and with an high arm brought he them out of it.
\p
\v 18 And about the time of forty years he bore with their ways in the wilderness.
\p
\v 19 And when he had destroyed seven nations in the land of Canaan,he gave them their land as an inheritance.
\p
\v 20 And after that he gave \add unto them\add* judges about the space of four hundred and fifty years, until Samuel the prophet.
\p
\v 21 And afterward they desired a king: and God gave unto them Saul the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin, for the space of forty years.
\p
\v 22 And when he had removed him, he raised up unto them David to be their king; to whom also he gave testimony, and said, I have found David the \add son\add* of Jesse, a man after my own heart, who will fulfil all my will.
\p
\v 23 Of this man’s seed hath God according to \add his\add* promise raised unto Israel a Saviour, Jesus,
\p
\v 24 When John had first preached before his coming the baptism of repentance to all the people of Israel.
\p
\v 25 And as John fulfilled his course, he said, Whom think ye that I am? I am not \add he.\add* But, behold, there cometh one after me, whose shoes of \add his\add* feet I am not worthy to loose.
\p
\v 26 Brethren, children of the stock of Abraham, and whosoever among you feareth God, to you is the word of this salvation sent.
\p
\v 27 For they that dwell at Jerusalem, and their rulers, because they knew him not, nor yet the voices of the prophets which are read every sabbath day, they have fulfilled \add them\add* in condemning \add him.\add* 
\p
\v 28 And though they found no cause of death in him, yet desired they Pilate that he should be slain.
\p
\v 29 And when they had fulfilled all that was written of him, they took \add him\add* down from the tree, and laid \add him\add* in a sepulchre.
\p
\v 30 But God raised him from the dead.
\p
\v 31 And he was seen many days by them who came up with him from Galilee to Jerusalem, who are his witnesses unto the people.
\p
\v 32 And we declare unto you glad tidings, how that the promise which was made unto the fathers,
\p
\v 33 God hath fulfilled the same unto us their children, in that he hath raised up Jesus again; as it is also written in the second psalm, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee.
\p
\v 34 And as concerning that he raised him up from the dead, \add now\add* no more to return to corruption, he said on this wise, I will give you the sure mercies of David.
\p
\v 35 Wherefore he saith also in another \add psalm,\add* Thou shalt not suffer thy Holy One to see corruption.
\p
\v 36 For David, after he had served his own generation by the will of God, fell asleep, and was laid beside his fathers, and saw corruption:
\p
\v 37 But he whom God raised again saw no corruption.
\p
\v 38 ¶ Be it known unto you therefore, brethren, that through this man is preached unto you the forgiveness of sins:
\p
\v 39 And by him all that believe are justified from all things, from which ye could not be justified by the law of Moses.
\p
\v 40 Beware therefore, lest that come upon you, which is spoken of in the prophets;
\p
\v 41 Behold, ye despisers, and wonder, and perish: for I work a work in your days, a work which ye shall in no wise believe, though a man declare it unto you.
\p
\v 42 And as they went out, they besought that these words might be preached to them the next sabbath.
\p
\v 43 Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God.
\p
\v 44 ¶ And the next sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God.
\p
\v 45 But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.
\p
\v 46 Then Paul and Barnabas waxed bold, and said, It was necessary that the word of God should first have been spoken to you: but seeing ye thrust it from you, and judge yourselves unworthy of everlasting life, lo, we turn to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 47 For so hath the Lord commanded us, \add saying,\add* I have set thee to be a light of the Gentiles, that thou shouldst be for salvation unto the ends of the earth.
\p
\v 48 And when the Gentiles heard this, they were glad, and glorified the word of the Lord: and as many as were ordained to eternal life believed.
\p
\v 49 And the word of the Lord was published throughout all the region.
\p
\v 50 But the Jews stirred up the devout women of rank, and the chief men of the city, and raised persecution against Paul and Barnabas, and expelled them out of their borders.
\p
\v 51 But they shook off the dust of their feet against them, and came unto Iconium.
\p
\v 52 And the disciples were filled with joy, and with the Holy Ghost.
\c 14
\cl CHAPTER 14
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass in Iconium, that they went both together into the synagogue of the Jews, and so spake, that a great multitude both of the Jews and also of the Greeks believed.
\p
\v 2 But the unbelieving Jews stirred up the Gentiles, and made their minds embittered against the brethren.
\p
\v 3 Long time therefore abode they speaking boldly in the Lord, who gave testimony unto the word of his grace, and granted signs and wonders to be done by their hands.
\p
\v 4 But the multitude of the city was divided: and part held with the Jews, and part with the apostles.
\p
\v 5 And when there was an assault made both of the Gentiles, and also of the Jews with their rulers, to use \add them\add* despitefully, and to stone them,
\p
\v 6 They were aware of \add it,\add* and fled unto Lystra and Derbe, cities of Lycaonia, and unto the region that lieth round about:
\p
\v 7 And there they preached the gospel.
\p
\v 8 ¶ And there sat a certain man at Lystra, impotent in his feet, being a cripple from his mother’s womb, who never had walked:
\p
\v 9 The same heard Paul speak: who stedfastly beholding him, and perceiving that he had faith to be healed,
\p
\v 10 Said with a loud voice, Stand upright on thy feet. And he leaped and walked.
\p
\v 11 And when the people saw what Paul had done, they lifted up their voices, saying in the speech of Lycaonia, The gods are come down to us in the likeness of men.
\p
\v 12 And they called Barnabas, Jupiter; and Paul, Mercury, because he was the chief speaker.
\p
\v 13 Then the priest of Jupiter, who was before their city, brought oxen and garlands unto the gates, and would have done sacrifice with the people.
\p
\v 14 \add Which\add* when the apostles, Barnabas and Paul, heard \add of,\add* they rent their clothes, and ran in among the people, crying out,
\p
\v 15 And saying, Sirs, why do ye these things? We also are men of like passions with you, and preach unto you that ye should turn from these vanities unto the living God, who made heaven, and earth, and the sea, and all things that are therein;
\p
\v 16 Who in times past suffered all nations to walk in their own ways.
\p
\v 17 Nevertheless he left not himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food and gladness.
\p
\v 18 And with these sayings scarce restrained they the people, from offering sacrifice unto them.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And there came thither \add certain\add* Jews from Antioch and Iconium, who persuaded the people, and, having stoned Paul, dragged \add him\add* out of the city, supposing he was dead.
\p
\v 20 Howbeit, as the disciples stood round about him, he rose up, and came into the city: and the next day he departed with Barnabas to Derbe.
\p
\v 21 And when they had preached the gospel to that city, and had made many disciples, they returned to Lystra, and Iconium, and Antioch,
\p
\v 22 Confirming the souls of the disciples, and exhorting them to continue in the faith, and that we must through many tribulations enter into the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 23 And when they had ordained them elders in every church, and had prayed with fasting, they commended them to the Lord, on whom they believed.
\p
\v 24 And after they had passed throughout Pisidia, they came to Pamphylia.
\p
\v 25 And when they had preached the word in Perga, they went down into Attalia:
\p
\v 26 And thence sailed to Antioch, from whence they had been committed to the grace of God for the work which they fulfilled.
\p
\v 27 And when they were come, and had gathered the church together, they rehearsed all that God had done with them, and how he had opened the door of faith unto the Gentiles.
\p
\v 28 And there they abode a long time with the disciples.
\c 15
\cl CHAPTER 15
\p
\v 1 ¶ And certain men who came down from Judaea taught the brethren, \add and said,\add* Except ye be circumcised after the manner of Moses, ye cannot be saved.
\p
\v 2 When therefore Paul and Barnabas had no small dissension and disputation with them, they determined that Paul and Barnabas, and certain other of them, should go up to Jerusalem unto the apostles and elders about this question.
\p
\v 3 And being brought on their way by the church, they passed through Phoenicia and Samaria, declaring the conversion of the Gentiles: and they caused great joy unto all the brethren.
\p
\v 4 And when they were come to Jerusalem, they were received by the church, and the apostles and elders, and they declared all things that God had done with them.
\p
\v 5 But there rose up certain of the sect of the Pharisees that believed, saying that it was needful to circumcise them, and to command \add them\add* to keep the law of Moses.
\p
\v 6 ¶ And the apostles and elders came together to consider this matter.
\p
\v 7 And when there had been much questioning, Peter rose up, and said unto them. Brethren, ye know how that a good while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and believe.
\p
\v 8 And God, who knoweth the hearts, bare them witness, giving them the Holy Spirit, even as unto us;
\p
\v 9 And put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.
\p
\v 10 Now therefore why tempt ye God, to put a yoke upon the neck of the disciples, which neither our fathers nor we were able to bear?
\p
\v 11 But we believe that through the grace of the Lord Jesus we shall be saved, even as they.
\p
\v 12 ¶ Then all the multitude kept silence, and gave audience to Barnabas and Paul, declaring what miracles and wonders God had wrought among the Gentiles by them.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And after they had held their peace, James answered, saying, Brethren, hearken unto me.
\p
\v 14 Simon hath declared how God for the first time visited the Gentiles, to take out of them a people for his name.
\p
\v 15 And to this agree the words of the prophets; as it is written,
\p
\v 16 After this I will return, and will build again the house of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up:
\p
\v 17 That the residue of men might seek after the Lord, and all the Gentiles, upon whom my name is called, saith the Lord, who doeth all these things.
\p
\v 18 Known unto God are all his works from eternity.
\p
\v 19 Wherefore my judgment is that we trouble not those who from among the Gentiles are turned to God:
\p
\v 20 But that we write unto them, that they abstain from pollutions of idols, and \add from\add* fornication, and \add from\add* things strangled, and \add from\add* blood.
\p
\v 21 For Moses of old time hath in every city them that preach him, being read in the synagogues every sabbath day.
\p
\v 22 Then pleased it the apostles and elders, with the whole church, to send chosen men of their own company to Antioch with Paul and Barnabas; \add namely,\add* Judas surnamed Barsabas, and Silas, chief men among the brethren:
\p
\v 23 And they wrote by them after this manner: The apostles and elders and brethren \add send\add* greeting unto the brethren who are from the Gentiles in Antioch and Syria and Cilicia:
\p
\v 24 Forasmuch as we have heard, that some who went out from us have troubled you with words, subverting your souls, saying, \add Ye must\add* be circumcised, and keep the law— to whom we gave no \add such\add* commandment;
\p
\v 25 It seemed good unto us, being assembled with one accord, to send chosen men unto you with our beloved Barnabas and Paul,
\p
\v 26 Men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 27 We have sent therefore Judas and Silas, who shall also tell \add you\add* the same things by mouth.
\p
\v 28 For it seemed good to the Holy Spirit, and to us, to lay upon you no greater burden than these necessary things:
\p
\v 29 That ye abstain from things sacrificed to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication; from which if ye keep yourselves, it shall be well with you. Fare ye well.
\p
\v 30 So when they were dismissed, they came to Antioch, and when they had gathered the multitude together, they delivered the epistle,
\p
\v 31 \add Which\add* when they had read, they rejoiced for the consolation.
\p
\v 32 And Judas and Silas, being prophets also themselves, exhorted the brethren with many words, and confirmed \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 33 And after they had tarried \add there\add* a space, they were let go in peace from the brethren unto those who had sent them.
\p
\v 34 Notwithstanding it pleased Silas to abide there still.
\p
\v 35 Paul also and Barnabas continued in Antioch, teaching and preaching the word of the Lord, with many others also.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And some days after Paul said unto Barnabas, Let us go again and visit our brethren in every city where we have preached the word of the Lord, \add and see\add* how they do.
\p
\v 37 And Barnabas proposed to take with them John, whose surname was Mark.
\p
\v 38 But Paul thought not good to take him with them, who departed from them from Pamphylia, and went not with them to the work.
\p
\v 39 And the contention was so sharp between them, that they departed asunder one from the other; and so Barnabas took Mark, and sailed unto Cyprus;
\p
\v 40 And Paul chose Silas, and departed, being committed by the brethren unto the grace of God.
\p
\v 41 And he went through Syria and Cilicia, confirming the churches.
\c 16
\cl CHAPTER 16
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then came he to Derbe and Lystra: and, behold, a certain disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman, a believer; but his father \add was\add* a Greek;
\p
\v 2 Who was well reported of by the brethren that were at Lystra and Iconium.
\p
\v 3 Him would Paul have to go forth with him; and took and circumcised him because of the Jews that were in those quarters: for they all knew that his father was a Greek.
\p
\v 4 And as they went through the cities, they delivered them the decrees for observance, which had been ordained by the apostles and elders that were at . Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 And so were the churches established in the faith, and increased in number daily.
\p
\v 6 Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden by the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia,
\p
\v 7 After they were come to Mysia, they attempted to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not.
\p
\v 8 And they passing by Mysia came down to Troas.
\p
\v 9 And a vision appeared to Paul in the night. There stood a man of Macedonia, beseeching him, and saying, Come over into Macedonia, and help us.
\p
\v 10 And after he had seen the vision, immediately we endeavoured to go into Macedonia, assuredly gathering that the Lord had called us to preach the gospel unto them.
\p
\v 11 Therefore loosing from Troas, we came with a straight course to Samothracia, and the next day to Neapolis;
\p
\v 12 And from thence to Philippi, which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia, \add and\add* a colony: and we were in that city abiding certain days.
\p
\v 13 And on the sabbath we went out of the city by a river side, where prayer was wont to be made; and we sat down, and spake unto the women that resorted \add thither\add*.
\p
\v 14 ¶ And a certain woman named Lydia, a seller of purple, of the city of Thyatira, who worshipped God, heard \add us:\add* whose heart the Lord opened, that she attended unto the things which were spoken by Paul.
\p
\v 15 And when she was baptized, and her household, she besought \add us,\add* saying, If ye have judged me to be a believer in the Lord, come into my house, and abide. And she constrained us.
\p
\v 16 ¶ And it came to pass, as we went to prayer, a certain maidservant possessed with a spirit of divination met us, who brought her masters much gain by soothsaying.
\p
\v 17 The same followed Paul and us, and cried, saying, These men are the servants of the Most High God, who show unto us the way of salvation.
\p
\v 18 And this did she many days. But Paul, being grieved, turned and said to the spirit, I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her. And he came out the same hour.
\p
\v 19 ¶ And when her masters saw that the hope of their gains was gone, they caught Paul and Silas, and dragged \add them\add* into the marketplace unto the rulers,
\p
\v 20 And brought them to the magistrates, saying, These men, being Jews, do exceedingly trouble our city,
\p
\v 21 And teach customs, which are not lawful for us to receive, neither to observe, being Romans.
\p
\v 22 And the multitude rose up together against them: and the magistrates rent off their clothes, and commanded to beat \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 23 And when they had laid many stripes upon them, they cast \add them\add* into prison, charging the jailor to keep them safely;
\p
\v 24 Who, having received such a charge, thrust them into the inner prison, and made their feet fast in the stocks.
\p
\v 25 ¶ And at midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns unto God; and the prisoners were listening to them.
\p
\v 26 And suddenly there was a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened, and every one’s bonds were loosed.
\p
\v 27 And the keeper of the prison awaking out of his sleep, and seeing the prison doors open, drew out his sword, and would have killed himself, supposing that the prisoners had fled.
\p
\v 28 But Paul cried with a loud voice, saying, Do thyself no harm: for we are all here.
\p
\v 29 Then he called for a light, and sprang in, and came trembling, and fell down before Paul and Silas,
\p
\v 30 And brought them out, and said, Sirs, what must I do to be saved?
\p
\v 31 And they said, Believe on the Lord Jesus, and thou shalt be saved, thou and thy house.
\p
\v 32 And they spake unto him the word of the Lord, and to all that were in his house.
\p
\v 33 And he took them the same hour of the night, and washed \add their\add* stripes; and was baptized, he and all his, straightway.
\p
\v 34 And when he had brought them into his house, he laid the table for them, and rejoiced, having believed God, with all his house.
\p
\v 35 And when it was day, the magistrates sent the sergeants, saying, Let those men go.
\p
\v 36 And the keeper of the prison told this saying to Paul, The magistrates have sent to let you go; now therefore depart, and go in peace.
\p
\v 37 But Paul said unto them, They have beaten us openly uncondemned, being Romans, and have cast \add us\add* into prison; and now do they thrust us out secretly? nay verily; but let them come themselves and fetch us out.
\p
\v 38 And the sergeants told these words unto the magistrates; and they feared, when they heard that they were Romans;
\p
\v 39 And they came and besought them, and brought \add them\add* out, and desired \add them\add* to depart out of the city
\p
\v 40 And they went out of the prison, and entered into \add the house of\add* Lydia; and when they had seen the brethren, they comforted them, and departed.
\c 17
\cl CHAPTER 17
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:
\p
\v 2 And Paul, as his manner was, went in unto them, and three sabbath days reasoned with them out of the scriptures,
\p
\v 3 Opening and alleging, that the Christ must needs have suffered, and risen again from the dead; and that this Jesus, whom I preach unto you, is the Christ.
\p
\v 4 And some of them were persuaded, and consorted with Paul and Silas; and of the devout Greeks a great multitude, and of the chief women not a few.
\p
\v 5 ¶ But the Jews, moved with envy, took unto them certain vile fellows of the rabble, and gathered a company, and set all the city in an uproar, and assaulted the house of Jason, and sought to bring them out to the people.
\p
\v 6 And when they found them not, they dragged Jason and certain brethren unto the rulers of the city, crying, These that have turned the world upside down are come hither also;
\p
\v 7 Whom Jason hath received; and these all do contrary to the decrees of Caesar, saying that there is another king, \add one\add* Jesus.
\p
\v 8 And they troubled the people and the rulers of the city, when they heard these things.
\p
\v 9 And when they had taken security of Jason, and of the other, they let them go.
\p
\v 10 ¶ And the brethren immediately sent away Paul and Silas by night unto Berea: who coming \add thither\add* went into the synagogue of the Jews.
\p
\v 11 These were more noble than those in Thessalonica, in that they received the word with all readiness of mind, and searched the scriptures daily, whether those things were so.
\p
\v 12 Therefore many of them believed; also of Greek women of rank, and of men, not a few.
\p
\v 13 But when the Jews of Thessalonica had knowledge that the word of God was preached by Paul at Berea, they came thither also, and stirred up the people.
\p
\v 14 And then immediately the brethren sent away Paul to go as it were to the sea: but Silas and Timothy abode there still.
\p
\v 15 And they that conducted Paul brought him unto Athens: and receiving a commandment unto Silas and Timothy to come to him with all speed, they departed.
\p
\v 16 ¶ Now while Paul waited for them at Athens, his spirit was stirred within him as he beheld the city full of idols.
\p
\v 17 Therefore he reasoned in the synagogue with the Jews, and with the devout persons, and in the market daily with them that met with him.
\p
\v 18 Then certain philosophers of the Epicureans, and of the Stoics, encountered him. And some said, What will this babbler say? But others, He seemeth to be a setter forth of strange gods; because he preached unto them Jesus, and the resurrection.
\p
\v 19 And they took him, and brought him unto Mars’ hill, saying, May we know what this new teaching, whereof thou speakest, \add is?\add*
\p
\v 20 For thou bringest certain strange things to our ears: we would know therefore what these things mean.
\p
\v 21 Now all the Athenians and the strangers sojourning there found time for nothing else but either to tell or to hear the last new thing.
\p
\v 22 ¶ Then Paul stood in the midst of Mars’ hill, and said, \add Ye\add* men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are very religious.
\p
\v 23 For as I passed by, and beheld the objects of your worship, I found an altar with this inscription, TO AN UNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.
\p
\v 24 The God who made the earth and all things therein, seeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands;
\p
\v 25 Neither is he served by men’s hands, as though he needed any thing, seeing he giveth to all life, and breath, and all things;
\p
\v 26 And hath made of one all nations of men to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;
\p
\v 27 That they should seek God, if perhaps they might feel after him, and find him, though he be not far from every one of us;
\p
\v 28 For in him we live, and move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said, For we are also his offspring.
\p
\v 29 Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver, or stone, graven by art and man’s device.
\p
\v 30 And the times of this ignorance God overlooked; but now commandeth all men every where to repent:
\p
\v 31 Because he hath appointed a day, in which he will judge the world in righteousness by \add that\add* man whom he hath ordained; \add whereof\add* he hath given assurance unto all \add men,\add* in that he hath raised him from the dead.
\p
\v 32 ¶ And when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said, We will hear thee again of this \add matter.\add* 
\p
\v 33 So Paul departed from among them.
\p
\v 34 Howbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed, among whom \add were\add* Dionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.
\c 18
\cl CHAPTER 18
\p
\v 1 ¶ After these things he departed from Athens, and came to Corinth;
\p
\v 2 And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome), and came unto them.
\p
\v 3 And because he was of the same craft, he abode with them, and wrought: for by their occupation they were tentmakers.
\p
\v 4 And he reasoned in the synagogue every sabbath, and persuaded the Jews and the Greeks.
\p
\v 5 And when Silas and Timothy were come from Macedonia, Paul was constrained by the word, and testified to the Jews \add that\add* Jesus \add was\add* the Christ.
\p
\v 6 And when they opposed themselves, and blasphemed, he shook \add his\add* raiment, and said unto them, Your blood \add be\add* upon your own heads; I \add am\add* clean: from henceforth I will go unto the Gentiles.
\p
\v 7 ¶ And he departed thence, and entered into a certain \add man’s\add* house, named Titus Justus, \add one\add* that worshipped God, whose house joined hard to the synagogue.
\p
\v 8 And Crispus, the chief ruler of the synagogue, believed on the Lord with all his house; and many of the Corinthians hearing, believed and were baptized.
\p
\v 9 Then spake the Lord to Paul in the night by a vision, Be not afraid, but speak, and hold not thy peace;
\p
\v 10 For I am with thee, and no man shall set on thee to hurt thee; for I have many people in this city.
\p
\v 11 And he continued \add there\add* a year and six months, teaching the word of God among them.
\p
\v 12 ¶ And when Gallio was the proconsul of Achaia, the Jews made insurrection with one accord against Paul, and brought him to the judgment seat,
\p
\v 13 Saying, This \add fellow\add* persuadeth men to worship God contrary to the law.
\p
\v 14 And when Paul was now about to open \add his\add* mouth, Gallio said unto the Jews, If it were a matter of wrong or wicked villainy, O \add ye\add* Jews, reason would that I should bear with you;
\p
\v 15 But if it be a question of words and names, and \add of\add* your law, look ye \add to it;\add* for I will be no judge of such \add matters.\add* 
\p
\v 16 And he drove them from the judgment seat.
\p
\v 17 And they all took Sosthenes, the chief ruler of the synagogue, and beat \add him\add* before the judgment seat. And Gallio cared for none of these things.
\p
\v 18 ¶ And Paul \add after this\add* tarried \add there\add* yet a good while, and then took his leave of the brethren, and sailed thence into Syria, and with him Priscilla and Aquila, having shorn \add his\add* head in Cenchrea, for he had a vow.
\p
\v 19 And he came to Ephesus, and left them there, but he himself entered into the synagogue, and reasoned with the Jews.
\p
\v 20 When they desired \add him\add* to tarry longer time with them, he consented not,
\p
\v 21 But bade them farewell, saying, I will return again unto you, if God will. And he sailed from Ephesus.
\p
\v 22 And when he had landed at Caesarea, and gone up, and saluted the church, he went down to Antioch.
\p
\v 23 And after he had spent some time \add there,\add* he departed, and went over \add all\add* the country of Galatia and Phrygia in order, strengthening all the disciples.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And a certain Jew named Apollos, born at Alexandria, an eloquent man, \add and\add* mighty in the scriptures, came to Ephesus.
\p
\v 25 This man had been instructed in the way of the Lord; and being fervent in the spirit, he spake and taught diligently the things of Jesus, knowing only the baptism of John.
\p
\v 26 And he began to speak boldly in the synagogue: whom when Aquila and Priscilla had heard, they took him unto \add them,\add* and expounded unto him the way of God more thoroughly .
\p
\v 27 And when he was disposed to pass into Achaia, the brethren encouraged him, and wrote to the disciples to receive him: who, when he was come, helped them much that had believed through grace,
\p
\v 28 For he powerfully confuted the Jews, publicly showing by the scriptures that Jesus was the Christ.
\c 19
\cl CHAPTER 19
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, that, while Apollos was at Corinth, Paul having passed through the upper region, came to Ephesus; and finding certain disciples,
\p
\v 2 He said unto them, Did ye receive the Holy Spirit when ye believed? And they said unto him, We have not so much as heard whether there is a Holy Spirit.
\p
\v 3 And he said unto them, Unto what then were ye baptized? And they said, Unto John’s baptism.
\p
\v 4 Then said Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of repentance, saying unto the people that they should believe on him that should come after him, that is, on Jesus.
\p
\v 5 When they heard \add this,\add* they were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 6 And when Paul had laid \add his\add* hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them, and they spake with tongues, and prophesied.
\p
\v 7 And all the men were about twelve.
\p
\v 8 And he went into the synagogue, and spake boldly for the space of three months, disputing and persuading as to the things concerning the kingdom of God.
\p
\v 9 But when some were hardened, and believed not, but spake evil of the Way before the multitude, he departed from them, and separated the disciples, disputing daily in the school of one Tyrannus.
\p
\v 10 And this continued by the space of two years, so that all they that dwelt in Asia heard the word of the Lord, both Jews and Greeks.
\p
\v 11 And God wrought special miracles by the hands of Paul,
\p
\v 12 So that from his body were brought unto the sick handkerchiefs or aprons, and the diseases departed from them, and the evil spirits went out of them.
\p
\v 13 ¶ Then certain of the wandering Jewish exorcists took upon them to call over them that had evil spirits the name of the Lord Jesus, saying, I adjure you by Jesus, whom Paul preacheth.
\p
\v 14 And there were seven sons of \add one\add* Sceva, a Jew, \add and\add* chief of the priests, who did so.
\p
\v 15 And the evil spirit answered and said, Jesus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye?
\p
\v 16 And the man in whom the evil spirit was leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed against them, so that they fled out of that house naked and wounded.
\p
\v 17 And this came to be known to all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at Ephesus; and fear fell on them all, and the name of the Lord Jesus was magnified.
\p
\v 18 And many that believed came, and confessed, and showed their deeds.
\p
\v 19 Many of them also that practiced magical arts brought their books together, and burned them before all; and they counted the price of them, and found it fifty thousand \add pieces\add* of silver.
\p
\v 20 So mightily grew the word of God and prevailed.
\p
\v 21 ¶ After these things were ended, Paul purposed in spirit, when he had passed through Macedonia and Achaia, to go to Jerusalem, saying, After I have been there, I must also see Rome.
\p
\v 22 So he sent into Macedonia two of them that ministered unto him, Timothy and Erastus; but he himself stayed in Asia for a season.
\p
\v 23 And the same time there arose no small stir concerning the Way.
\p
\v 24 For a certain \add man\add* named Demetrius, a silversmith, who made silver shrines for Diana, brought no small gain unto the craftsmen;
\p
\v 25 Whom he called together with the workmen of like occupation, and said, Sirs, ye know that by this craft we have our wealth.
\p
\v 26 Moreover ye see and hear, that not alone at Ephesus, but almost throughout all Asia, this Paul hath persuaded and turned away many people, saying that they are no gods, which are made with hands;
\p
\v 27 So that not only this our craft is in danger to be set at naught; but also that the temple of the great goddess Diana should be despised, and her magnificence should be destroyed, whom all Asia and the inhabited earth worshippeth.
\p
\v 28 And when they heard \add these sayings,\add* they were full of wrath, and cried out, saying, Great \add is\add* 3 Diana of the Ephesians.
\p
\v 29 And the whole city was filled with confusion, and having caught Gains and Aristarchus, men of Macedonia, Paul’s companions in travel, they rushed with one accord into the theatre.
\p
\v 30 And when Paul would have entered in unto the people, the disciples suffered him not.
\p
\v 31 And certain of the Asiarchs, who were his friends, sent unto him, urging that he would not adventure himself into the theatre.
\p
\v 32 Some therefore cried one thing, and some another, for the assembly was confused; and the more part knew not wherefore they were come together.
\p
\v 33 And they drew Alexander out of the multitude, the Jews putting him forward. And Alexander beckoned with the hand, and would have made a defence unto the people.
\p
\v 34 But when they knew that he was a Jew, all with one voice about the space of two hours cried out, Great is aDiana of the Ephesians !
\p
\v 35 And when the townclerk had quieted the people, he said, \add Ye\add* men of Ephesus, what man is there that knoweth not how that the city of the Ephesians is temple-keeper of the great goddess Diana, and of the \add image\add* which fell down from Jupiter?
\p
\v 36 Seeing then that these things cannot be spoken against, ye ought to be quiet, and to do nothing rashly.
\p
\v 37 For ye have brought hither these men, who are neither robbers of temples, nor yet blasphemers of your goddess.
\p
\v 38 Wherefore if Demetrius, and the craftsmen who are with him, have a matter against any man, courts are held, and there are proconsuls; let them prosecute one another.
\p
\v 39 But if ye inquire any thing concerning other matters, it shall be determined in a lawful assembly.
\p
\v 40 For we are in danger to be called in question for this day’s uproar, there being no cause whereby we may give an account of this concourse.
\p
\v 41 And when he had thus spoken, he dismissed the assembly.
\c 20
\cl CHAPTER 20
\p
\v 1 ¶ And after the uproar had ceased, Paul called unto \add him\add* the disciples, and embraced \add them,\add* and departed to go into Macedonia.
\p
\v 2 And when he had gone over those parts, and had given them much exhortation, he came into Greece,
\p
\v 3 And \add there\add* abode three months. And when a plot was formed against him by the Jews, as he was about to sail into Syria, he purposed to return through Macedonia.
\p
\v 4 And there accompanied him into Asia, Sopater son of Pyrrhus, of Berea; and of the Thessalonians, Aristarchus and Secundus; and Gaius of Derbe, and Timothy; and of Asia Tychicus and Trophimus.
\p
\v 5 These going before tarried for us at Troas.
\p
\v 6 And we sailed away from Philippi after the days of unleavened bread, and came unto them to Troas in five days; where we abode seven days.
\p
\v 7 And upon the first \add day\add* of the week, when we came together to break bread, Paul preached unto them, ready to depart on the morrow; and continued his speech until midnight.
\p
\v 8 And there were many lights in the upper chamber, where we were gathered together.
\p
\v 9 And there sat in a window a certain young man named Eutychus, being fallen into a deep sleep; and as Paul was long preaching, he sank down with sleep, and fell down from the third story, and was taken up dead.
\p
\v 10 And Paul went down, and fell on him, and embracing \add him\add* said, Make ye no ado, for his life is in him.
\p
\v 11 When he therefore was come up again, and had broken bread, and eaten, and talked a long while, even till break of day, so he departed.
\p
\v 12 And they brought the young man alive, and were not a little comforted.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And we went before to the ship, and sailed unto Assos, there intending to take in Paul; for so had he appointed, intending himself to go afoot.
\p
\v 14 And when he met with us at Assos, we took him in, and came to Mitylene.
\p
\v 15 And we sailed thence, and came the next \add day\add* over against Chios; and the next \add day\add* we arrived at Samos, and tarried at Trogyllium; and the next \add day\add* we came to Miletus.
\p
\v 16 For Paul had determined to sail by Ephesus, that he might not have to spend the time in Asia: for he hasted, if it were possible for him to be at Jerusalem the day of Pentecost.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And from Miletus he sent to Ephesus, and called the elders of the church.
\p
\v 18 And when they were come to him, he said unto them, Ye know, from the first day that I came into Asia, after what manner I have been with you at all seasons,
\p
\v 19 Serving the Lord with all humility of mind, and with many tears, and temptations, which befell me through the plots of the Jews;
\p
\v 20 \add And\add* how I shrank not from declaring anything that was profitable \add unto you,\add* but have showed you, and have taught you publicly, and from house to house,
\p
\v 21 Testifying both to the Jews, and also to the Greeks, repentance toward God, and faith toward our Lord Jesus Christ.
\p
\v 22 And now, behold, I go bound in the spirit unto Jerusalem, not knowing the things that shall befall me there,
\p
\v 23 Save that the Holy Spirit witnesseth in every city, saying that bonds and afflictions abide me.
\p
\v 24 But none of these things move me, neither count I my life dear unto myself, so that I might finish my course with joy, and the ministry, which I have received of the Lord Jesus, to testify the gospel of the grace of God.
\p
\v 25 And now, behold, I know that ye all, among whom I have gone preaching the kingdom, shall see my face no more.
\p
\v 26 Wherefore I take you to record this day, that I \add am\add* pure from the blood of all \add men.\add* 
\p
\v 27 For I have not shunned to declare unto you all the counsel of God.
\p
\v 28 ¶ Take heed therefore unto yourselves, and to all the flock, over which the Holy Spirit hath made you overseers, to feed the church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood.
\p
\v 29 For I know this, that after my departing shall grievous wolves enter in among you, not sparing the flock.
\p
\v 30 Also of your own selves shall men arise, speaking perverse things, to draw away the disciples after them.
\p
\v 31 Therefore watch, and remember, that by the space of three years I ceased not to warn every one night and day with tears.
\p
\v 32 And now, brethren, I commend you to God, and to the word of his grace, which is able to build you up, and to give you an inheritance among all them that are sanctified.
\p
\v 33 I have coveted no man’s silver, or gold, or apparel.
\p
\v 34 Yea, ye yourselves know, that these hands have ministered unto my necessities, and to them that were with me.
\p
\v 35 In all things I have given you an example, how that so labouring ye ought to support the weak, and to remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said, It is more blessed to give than to receive.
\p
\v 36 ¶ And when he had thus spoken, he kneeled down, and prayed with them all.
\p
\v 37 And they all wept sore, and fell on Paul’s neck, and kissed him,
\p
\v 38 Sorrowing most of all for the words which he spake, that they should see his face no more. And they accompanied him unto the ship.
\c 21
\cl CHAPTER 21
\p
\v 1 ¶ And it came to pass, that after we were gotten from them, and had launched, we came with a straight course unto Cos, and the \add day\add* following unto Rhodes, and from thence unto Patara:
\p
\v 2 And finding a ship sailing over unto Phenicia, we went aboard, and set forth.
\p
\v 3 Now when we had come in sight of Cyprus, we left it on the left hand, and sailed unto Syria, and landed at Tyre: for there the ship was to unlade her burden.
\p
\v 4 And finding the disciples, we tarried there seven days: who said to Paul through the Spirit, that he should not set foot in Jerusalem.
\p
\v 5 And when we had accomplished those days, we departed and went our way; and they all brought us on our way, with wives and children, till \add we were\add* out of the city: and we kneeled down on the shore, and prayed.
\p
\v 6 And when we had taken our leave one of another, we took ship; and they returned home again.
\p
\v 7 And when we had finished \add our\add* course from Tyre, we came to Ptolemais, and saluted the brethren, and abode with them one day.
\p
\v 8 And the next \add day\add* we departed, and came unto Caesarea: and we entered into the house of Philip the evangelist, who was \add one\add* of the seven; and abode with him.
\p
\v 9 And the same man had four daughters, virgins, who did prophesy.
\p
\v 10 And as we tarried \add there\add* many days, there came down from Judaea a certain prophet, named Agabus.
\p
\v 11 And coming to us and taking Paul’s girdle, he bound his own hands and feet, and said. Thus saith the Holy Spirit, So shall the Jews at Jerusalem bind the man that owneth this girdle, and shall deliver him into the hands of the Gentiles.
\p
\v 12 And when we heard these things, both we, and they of that place, besought him not to go up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 13 Then Paul answered, What mean ye, to weep and to break my heart? for I am ready not to be bound only, but also to die at Jerusalem for the name of the Lord Jesus.
\p
\v 14 And when he would not be persuaded, we ceased, saying, The will of the Lord be done.
\p
\v 15 ¶ And after those days we took up our baggage, and went up to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 16 There went with us also \add certain\add of the disciples from Caesarea, and brought with them one Mnason of Cyprus, an early disciple, with whom we should lodge.
\p
\v 17 And when we were come to Jerusalem, the brethren received us gladly.
\p
\v 18 And the \add day\add* following Paul went in with us unto James; and all the elders were present.
\p
\v 19 And when he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things God had wrought among the Gentiles by his ministry.
\p
\v 20 And when they heard \add it,\add* they glorified God, and said unto him, Thou seest, brother, how many thousands of Jews there are that believe; and they are all zealous of the law:
\p
\v 21 And they are informed of thee, that thou teachest all the Jews that are among the Gentiles to forsake Moses, saying that they ought not to circumcise \add their\add* children, neither to walk after the customs.
\p
\v 22 What is it therefore? for they will certainly hear that thou art come.
\p
\v 23 Do therefore this that we say to thee: We have four men who have a vow on them;
\p
\v 24 Then take, and purify thyself with them, and bear their expenses, that they may shave \add their\add* heads: and all may know that those things, whereof they were informed concerning thee, are nothing; but \add that\add* thou thyself also walkest orderly, and keepest the law.
\p
\v 25 As touching the Gentiles that believe, we have written, deciding that they should observe no such thing, save only that they keep themselves from \add things\add* offered to idols, and from blood, and from things strangled, and from fornication.
\p
\v 26 Then Paul took the men, and the next day purifying himself with them entered into the temple, to signify the accomplishment of the days of purification, until that an offering should be offered for every one of them.
\p
\v 27 ¶ And when the seven days were almost ended, the Jews that were of Asia, when they saw him in the temple, stirred up all the people, and laid hands on him,
\p
\v 28 Crying out, Men of Israel, help! This is the man, that teacheth all \add men\add* every where against the people, and the law, and this place; and further brought Greeks also into the temple, and hath polluted this holy place.
\p
\v 29 For they had seen before with him in the city Trophimus the Ephesian, whom they supposed that Paul had brought into the temple.
\p
\v 30 And all the city was moved, and the people ran together, and they took Paul, and dragged him out of the temple, and forthwith the doors were shut.
\p
\v 31 And as they went about to kill him, tidings came unto the chief captain of the band, that all Jerusalem was in an uproar;
\p
\v 32 Who immediately took soldiers and centurions, and ran down unto them; and when they saw the chief captain and the soldiers, they left off beating Paul.
\p
\v 33 Then the chief captain came near, and took him, and commanded \add him\add* to be bound with two chains; and demanded who he was, and what he had done.
\p
\v 34 And some cried one thing, some another, among the multitude; and when he could not know the certainty for the tumult, he commanded him to be carried into the castle.
\p
\v 35 And when he came upon the stairs, so it was, that he was borne of the soldiers for the violence of the people.
\p
\v 36 For the multitude of the people followed after, crying, Away with him.
\p
\v 37 And as Paul was to be led into the castle, he said unto the chief captain, May I speak unto thee? Who said, Canst thou speak Greek?
\p
\v 38 Art not thou that Egyptian, who before these days madest an uproar, and leddest out into the wilderness four thousand men that were murderers?
\p
\v 39 But Paul said, I am a man \add who am\add* a Jew of Tarsus, \add a city\add* in Cilicia, a citizen of no mean city: and, I beseech thee, suffer me to speak unto the people.
\p
\v 40 And when he had given him licence, Paul stood on the stairs, and beckoned with the hand unto the people. And when there was made a great silence, he spake unto \add them\add* in the Hebrew tongue, saying:
\c 22
\cl CHAPTER 22
\p
\v 1 ¶ Brethren, and fathers, hear ye my defence \add which I make\add* now unto you.
\p
\v 2 And when they heard that he spake in the Hebrew tongue to them, they kept the more silence; and he saith,
\p
\v 3 I am a Jew, born in Tarsus, a city in Cilicia, yet brought up in this city at the feet of Gamaliel, and instructed according to the strict manner of the law of the fathers, and was zealous toward God, as ye all are this day.
\p
\v 4 And I persecuted this Way unto the death, binding and delivering into prisons both men and women.
\p
\v 5 As also the high priest doth bear me witness, and all the estate of the elders; from whom also I received letters unto the brethren, and went to Damascus, to bring them that were there bound unto Jerusalem, to be punished.
\p
\v 6 And it came to pass, that, as I made my journey, and was come nigh unto Damascus, about noon, suddenly there shone from heaven a great light round about me.
\p
\v 7 And I fell unto the ground, and heard a voice saying unto me, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me?
\p
\v 8 And I answered, Who art thou, Lord? And he said unto me, I am Jesus of Nazareth, whom thou persecutest.
\p
\v 9 And they that were with me saw indeed the light, but they heard not the voice of him that spake to me.
\p
\v 10 And I said, What shall I do, Lord? And the Lord said unto me, Arise, and go into Damascus; and there it shall be told thee of all things which are appointed for thee to do.
\p
\v 11 And as I could not see for the glory of that light, being led by the hand of them that were with me, I came into Damascus.
\p
\v 12 And one Ananias, a devout man according to the law, having a good report of all the Jews that dwelt \add there,\add* 
\p
\v 13 Came unto me, and stood, and said unto me, Brother Saul, receive thy sight. And the same hour I looked up upon him.
\p
\v 14 And he said, The God of our fathers hath chosen thee, that thou shouldst know his will, and see the Righteous One, and shouldst hear the voice of his mouth.
\p
\v 15 For thou shalt be his witness unto all men of what thou hast seen and heard.
\p
\v 16 And now why tarriest thou? arise, and be baptized, and wash away thy sins, calling on his name.
\p
\v 17 And it came to pass, that, when I was come again to Jerusalem, even while I prayed in the temple, I was in a trance,
\p
\v 18 And saw him saying unto me, Make haste, and get thee quickly out of Jerusalem, for they will not receive thy testimony concerning me.
\p
\v 19 And I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on thee;
\p
\v 20 And when the blood of thy martyr Stephen was shed, I also was standing by and consenting, and kept the raiment of them that slew him.
\p
\v 21 And he said unto me, Depart; for I will send thee far hence unto the Gentiles.
\p
\v 22 And they gave him audience unto this word, and \add then\add* lifted up their voices, and said, Away with such a \add fellow\add* from the earth! for it is not fit that he should live.
\p
\v 23 And as they cried out, and cast off \add their\add* clothes, and threw dust into the air,
\p
\v 24 The chief captain commanded him to be brought into the castle, and bade that he should be examined by scourging; that he might know for what cause they so shouted against him.
\p
\v 25 And when they had tied him up with thongs, Paul said unto the centurion that stood by, Is it lawful for you to scourge a man that is a Roman, and uncondemned?
\p
\v 26 When the centurion heard \add that,\add* he went and told the chief captain, saying, Take heed what thou doest, for this man is a Roman.
\p
\v 27 Then the chief captain came, and said unto him, Tell me, art thou a Roman? He said, Yea.
\p
\v 28 And the chief captain answered, With a great sum obtained I this citizenship. And Paul said, But I am a Roman born.
\p
\v 29 Then straightway they departed from him who were about to examine him; and the chief captain also was afraid, after he knew that he was a Roman, and because he had bound him.
\p
\v 30 On the morrow, because he would have known the certainty wherefore he was accused of the Jews, he loosed him, and commanded the chief priests and all their council to appear, and brought Paul down, and set him before them.
\c 23
\cl CHAPTER 23
\p
\v 1 ¶ And Paul, earnestly beholding the council, said, Brethren, I have lived in all good conscience before God unto this day.
\p
\v 2 And the high priest Ananias commanded them that stood by him to smite him on the mouth.
\p
\v 3 Then said Paul unto him, God shall smite thee, \add thou\add* whited wall; for sittest thou to judge me according to the law, and commandest me to be smitten contrary to the law?
\p
\v 4 And they that stood by said, Revilest thou God’s high priest?
\p
\v 5 Then said Paul, I knew not, brethren, that he was the high priest; for it is written, Thou shalt not speak evil of the ruler of thy people.
\p
\v 6 But when Paul perceived that the one part were Sadducees, and the other Pharisees, he cried out in the council, Brethren, I am a Pharisee, the son of Pharisees! Of the hope and resurrection of the dead I am called in question.
\p
\v 7 And when he had so said, there arose a dissension between the Pharisees and the Sadducees: and the assembly was divided.
\p
\v 8 For the Sadducees say that there is no resurrection, neither angel, nor spirit: but the Pharisees confess both.
\p
\v 9 And there arose a great clamour; and the scribes \add that were\add* of the Pharisees’ part arose, and strove, saying, We find no evil in this man; and what if a spirit or an angel hath spoken to him?
\p
\v 10 And when there arose a great dissension, the chief captain, fearing lest Paul should have been pulled in pieces of them, commanded the soldiers to go down, and to take him by force from among them, and to bring \add him\add* into the castle.
\p
\v 11 And the night following, the Lord stood by him, and said, Be of good cheer, for as thou hast testified of me in Jerusalem, so must thou bear testimony also at Rome.
\p
\v 12 And when it was day, the Jews banded together, and bound themselves under a curse, saying that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed Paul.
\p
\v 13 And they were more than forty that had made this conspiracy.
\p
\v 14 And they came to the chief priests and elders, and said, We have bound ourselves under a great curse, that we will taste nothing until we have slain Paul.
\p
\v 15 Now therefore ye with the council signify to the chief captain that he bring him down unto you, as though ye would inquire something more perfectly concerning him; and we, or ever he come near, are ready to kill him.
\p
\v 16 But when Paul’s sister’s son heard of their lying in wait, he went and entered into the castle, and told Paul.
\p
\v 17 Then Paul called one of the centurions unto \add him,\add* and said, Bring this young man unto the chief captain: for he hath a certain thing to tell him.
\p
\v 18 So he took him, and brought \add him\add* to the chief captain, and said, Paul the prisoner called me unto \add him,\add* and prayed me to bring this young man unto thee, who hath something to say unto thee.
\p
\v 19 Then the chief captain took him by the hand, and went \add with him\add* aside privately, and asked \add him,\add* What is that thou hast to tell me?
\p
\v 20 And he said, The Jews have agreed to desire thee that thou wouldest bring down Paul to morrow into the council, as though they would inquire somewhat of him more perfectly.
\p
\v 21 But do not thou yield unto them; for there lie in wait for him of them more than forty men, who have bound themselves with an oath, that they will neither eat nor drink till they have killed him; and now are they ready, looking for a promise from thee.
\p
\v 22 So the chief captain \add then\add* let the young man depart, and charged \add him, See thou\add* tell no man that thou hast showed these things to me.
\p
\v 23 And he called unto \add him\add* two centurions, saying, Make ready two hundred soldiers to go to Caesarea, and horsemen threescore and ten, and spearmen two hundred, at the third hour of the night;
\p
\v 24 And provide \add them\add* beasts, that they may set Paul on, and bring \add him\add* safe unto Felix the governor.
\p
\v 25 And he wrote a letter after this manner:
\p
\v 26 Claudius Lysias unto the most excellent governor Felix \add sendeth\add* greeting.
\p
\v 27 This man was seized by the Jews, and should have been killed of them; then I came upon them with the soldiers, and rescued him, having understood that he was a Roman.
\p
\v 28 And when I would have known the cause wherefore they accused him, I brought him forth into their council;
\p
\v 29 Whom I perceived to be accused of questions of their law, but to have nothing laid to his charge worthy of death or of bonds.
\p
\v 30 And when it was told me how that the Jews laid wait for the man, I sent straightway to thee, and gave commandment to his accusers also to say before thee what \add they had\add* against him. Farewell.
\p
\v 31 Then the soldiers, as it was commanded them, took Paul, and brought \add him\add* by night to Antipatris.
\p
\v 32 On the morrow they left the horsemen to go with him, and returned to the castle;
\p
\v 33 Who, when they came to Caesarea, and delivered the epistle to the governor, presented Paul also before him.
\p
\v 34 And having read it, he asked of what province he was. And when he understood that \add he was\add* of Cilicia;
\p
\v 35 I will hear thee, said he, when thine accusers are also come. And he commanded him to be kept in Herod’s palace.
\c 24
\cl CHAPTER 24
\p
\v 1 ¶ And after five days Ananias the high priest came down with the elders, and \add with\add* a certain orator \add named\add* Tertullus, who informed the governor against Paul.
\p
\v 2 And when he was called forth, Tertullus began to accuse \add him,\add* saying, Seeing that by thee we enjoy great quietness, and that very worthy deeds are done unto this nation by thy care,
\p
\v 3 We accept \add it\add* always, and in all places, most noble Felix, with all thankfulness.
\p
\v 4 But, that I be not further tedious unto thee, I pray thee that thou wouldest hear us of thy clemency a few words.
\p
\v 5 For we have found this man \add a\add* pest, and a mover of sedition among all the Jews throughout the inhabited earth, and a ringleader of the sect of the Nazarenes;
\p
\v 6 Who also hath gone about to profane the temple; whom we seized, and would have judged according to our law.
\p
\v 7 But the chief captain Lysias came \add upon us,\add* and with great violence took \add him\add* away out of our hands,
\p
\v 8 Commanding his accusers to come unto thee; by examining of whom thyself mayest take knowledge of all these things, whereof we accuse him.
\p
\v 9 And the Jews also assented, saying that these things were so.
\p
\v 10 Then Paul, after that the governor had beckoned unto him to speak, answered, Forasmuch as I know that thou hast been of many years a judge unto this nation, I do the more cheerfully answer for myself;
\p
\v 11 Because that thou mayest understand, that there are yet but twelve days since I went up to Jerusalem to worship.
\p
\v 12 And they neither found me in the temple disputing with any man, neither raising up the people, neither in the synagogues, nor in the city
\p
\v 13 Neither can they prove the things whereof they now accuse me.
\p
\v 14 But this I confess unto thee, that after the Way which they call heresy, so worship I the God of my fathers, believing all things which are written in the law and in the prophets,
\p
\v 15 And have hope toward God, which they themselves also accept, that there shall be a resurrection, both of the just and unjust.
\p
\v 16 And herein do I exercise myself, to have always a conscience void of offence toward God, and \add toward\add* men.
\p
\v 17 Now after many years I came to bring alms to my nation, and offerings.
\p
\v 18 Whereupon certain Jews from Asia found me purified in the temple, neither with multitude, nor with tumult;
\p
\v 19 Who ought to have been here before thee, and accuse, if they had aught against me.
\p
\v 20 Or else let these themselves say, if they have found any evil doing in me, while I stood before the council,
\p
\v 21 Except it be for this one voice, that I cried standing among them, Touching the resurrection of the dead I am called in question by you this day!
\p
\v 22 And when Felix heard these things, having more perfect knowledge concerning the Way, he deferred them, and said, When Lysias the chief captain shall come down, I will determine your matter.
\p
\v 23 And he commanded the centurion to keep Paul, and to let \add him\add* have liberty, and that he should forbid none of his acquaintance to minister or come unto him.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And after certain days, when Felix came with his wife Drusilla, who was a Jewess, he sent for Paul, and heard him concerning the faith in Christ Jesus.
\p
\v 25 And as he reasoned of righteousness, self-control, and the judgment to come, Felix, becoming afraid, answered, Go thy way for this time; when I have a convenient season, I will call for thee.
\p
\v 26 He hoped also that money should have been given him of Paul; wherefore he sent for him the oftener, and conversed with him.
\p
\v 27 But when two years were fulfilled, Felix was succeeded by Porcius Festus; and desiring to gain favour with the Jews, Felix left Paul in bonds.
\c 25
\cl CHAPTER 25
\p
\v 1 ¶ Now when Festus was come into the province, after three days he went up from Caesarea to Jerusalem.
\p
\v 2 Then the high priest and the chief of the Jews informed him against Paul, and besought him,
\p
\v 3 Asking as a favour against him, that he would send for him to Jerusalem, laying a plot to kill him on the way.
\p
\v 4 But Festus answered, that Paul should be kept at Caesarea, and that he himself would depart shortly \add thither.\add* 
\p
\v 5 Let them therefore, said he, that among you are able, go down with \add me,\add* and accuse this man, if there be any wickedness in him.
\p
\v 6 And when he had tarried among them more than ten days, he went down unto Caesarea; and the next day sitting on the judgment seat commanded Paul to be brought.
\p
\v 7 And when he was come, the Jews who came down from Jerusalem stood round about, and laid many and grievous complaints against Paul, which they could not prove.
\p
\v 8 But Paul said in defence: Neither against the law of the Jews, neither against the temple, nor yet against Caesar, have I committed any offence.
\p
\v 9 But Festus, willing to do the Jews a pleasure, answered Paul, and said, Wilt thou go up to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these things before me?
\p
\v 10 Then said Paul, I stand at Caesar’s judgment seat, where I ought to be judged: to the Jews have I done no wrong, as thou also very well knowest.
\p
\v 11 For if I be an offender, or have committed any thing worthy of death, I refuse not to die; but if there be none of these things whereof these accuse me, no man may deliver me unto them. I appeal unto Caesar.
\p
\v 12 Then Festus, when he had conferred with the council, answered, Hast thou appealed unto Caesar? unto Caesar shalt thou go.
\p
\v 13 ¶ And after certain days king Agrippa and Bernice came unto Caesarea to salute Festus.
\p
\v 14 And when they had been there many days, Festus declared Paul’s cause unto the king, saying, There is a certain man left in bonds by Felix,
\p
\v 15 About whom, when I was at Jerusalem, the chief priests and the elders of the Jews informed \add me,\add* desiring \add to have\add* judgment against him.
\p
\v 16 To whom I answered, It is not the custom of the Romans to deliver any man to die, before that he who is accused has the accusers face to face, and has opportunity to answer for himself concerning the crime laid against him.
\p
\v 17 Therefore, when they were come hither, without any delay on the morrow I sat on the judgment seat, and commanded the man to be brought forth.
\p
\v 18 Against whom when the accusers stood up, they brought no accusation of such things as I supposed,
\p
\v 19 But had certain questions against him of their own superstition, and of one Jesus, who was dead, whom Paul affirmed to be alive.
\p
\v 20 And being perplexed as to the manner of investigating these things, I asked \add him\add* whether he would go to Jerusalem, and there be judged of these matters.
\p
\v 21 But when Paul had appealed to be kept for the decision of the emperor, I commanded him to be kept till I might send him to Caesar.
\p
\v 22 Then Agrippa said unto Festus, I would also hear the man myself. To morrow, said he, thou shalt hear him.
\p
\v 23 ¶ And on the morrow, when Agrippa was come, and Bernice, with great pomp, and was entered into the place of hearing, with the chief captains, and principal men of the city, at Festus’ commandment Paul was brought forth.
\p
\v 24 And Festus said: King Agrippa, and all who are here present with us, ye see this man, about whom all the multitude of the Jews have petitioned me, both at Jerusalem, and \add also\add* here, crying that he ought not to live any longer.
\p
\v 25 But I found that he had committed nothing worthy of death, and as he himself had appealed to the emperor, I determined to send him;
\p
\v 26 Of whom I have nothing certain to write unto my lord. Wherefore I have brought him forth before you, and especially before thee, O king Agrippa, that, when the examination has taken place, I might have somewhat to write.
\p
\v 27 For it seemeth to me unreasonable to send a prisoner, and not withal to signify the crimes \add laid\add* against him.
\c 26
\cl CHAPTER 26
\p
\v 1 ¶ Then Agrippa said unto Paul, Thou art permitted to speak for thyself. Then Paul stretched forth the hand, and answered for himself:
\p
\v 2 I think myself happy, king Agrippa, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews;
\p
\v 3 Especially \add because I know\add* thee to be expert in all customs and questions which are among the Jews: wherefore I beseech thee to hear me patiently.
\p
\v 4 My manner of life from my youth, which was at the first among my own nation at Jerusalem, know all the Jews;
\p
\v 5 Who knew me from the beginning, if they would testify, that after the strictest sect of our religion I lived a Pharisee.
\p
\v 6 And now I stand and am judged for the hope of the promise made of God unto our fathers:
\p
\v 7 Unto which \add promise\add* our twelve tribes, earnestly serving \add God\add* day and night, hope to come. For which hope’s sake, king Agrippa, I am accused of the Jews.
\p
\v 8 Why should it be judged a thing incredible with you, if God doth raise the dead?
\p
\v 9 I verily thought with myself, that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth.
\p
\v 10 Which thing I also did in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up in prisons, having received authority from the chief priests; and when they were put to death, I gave my vote against \add them.\add* 
\p
\v 11 And I punished them oft in every synagogue, to compel \add them\add* to blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them, I persecuted \add them\add* even unto strange cities.
\p
\v 12 Whereupon as I went to Damascus with the authority and commission of the chief priests,
\p
\v 13 At midday, O king, I saw in the way a light from heaven, above the brightness of the sun, shining round about me and those journeying with me.
\p
\v 14 And when we were all fallen to the earth, I heard a voice speaking unto me, and saying in the Hebrew tongue, Saul, Saul, why persecutest thou me? \add it is\add* hard for thee to kick against the goads.
\p
\v 15 And I said, Who art thou, Lord? And the Lord said, I am Jesus, whom thou persecutest.
\p 
\v 16 But rise, and stand upon thy feet; for I have appeared unto thee for this purpose, to make thee a minister and a witness both of these things in which thou hast seen me, and of those things in which I will appear unto thee;
\p
\v 17 Delivering thee from the people, and \add from\add* the Gentiles, unto whom now I send thee,
\p
\v 18 To open their eyes, that they may turn from darkness to light, and the power of Satan unto God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins, and inheritance among them that are sanctified by faith in me.
\p
\v 19 Whereupon, O king Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the heavenly vision:
\p
\v 20 But announced first unto them of Damascus, and at Jerusalem, and throughout all the coasts of Judaea, and \add then\add* to the Gentiles, that they should repent and turn to God, doing works consistent with repentance.
\p
\v 21 For these causes the Jews caught me in the temple, and went about to kill \add me.\add* 
\p
\v 22 Having therefore obtained help of God, I continue unto this day, witnessing both to small and great, saying none other things than those which the prophets and Moses did say should come:
\p
\v 23 That the Christ must suffer, \add and\add* that he should be the first that should rise from the dead, and should proclaim light unto the people, and to the Gentiles.
\p
\v 24 ¶ And as he thus spake for himself, Festus said with a loud voice, Paul, thou art beside thyself; much learning doth make thee mad.
\p
\v 25 But Paul said, I am not mad, most noble Festus; but speak forth words of truth and soberness.
\p
\v 26 For the king knoweth of these things, before whom also I speak freely; for I am persuaded that none of these things is hidden from him; for this thing was not done in a corner.
\p
\v 27 King Agrippa, believest thou the prophets? I know that thou believest.
\p
\v 28 Then Agrippa \add said\add* unto Paul, With but little persuasion thou wouldst fain make me a Christian.
\p
\v 29 And Paul said, I would to God, that, whether with little or with much, not only thou, but also all that hear me this day, should become such as I am, except these bonds.
\p
\v 30 And the king rose up, and the governor, and Bernice, and they that sat with them,
\p
\v 31 And when they were gone aside, they talked between themselves, saying, This man doeth nothing worthy of death or of bonds.
\p
\v 32 And Agrippa said unto Festus, This man might have been set at liberty, if he had not appealed unto Caesar.
\c 27
\cl CHAPTER 27
\p
\v 1 ¶ And when it was determined that we should sail for Italy, they delivered Paul and certain other prisoners unto \add one\add* named Julius, a centurion of the Augustan band.
\p
\v 2 And entering into a ship of Adramyttium, we launched, meaning to sail by the coasts of Asia; \add one\add* Aristarchus, a Macedonian of Thessalonica, being with us.
\p
\v 3 And the next \add day\add* we touched at Sidon. And Julius courteously treated Paul, and gave \add him\add* liberty to go unto his friends to refresh himself.
\p
\v 4 And when we had launched from thence, we sailed under Cyprus, because the winds were contrary.
\p
\v 5 And when we had sailed over the sea which is off Cilicia and Pamphylia, we came to Myra, \add a city\add* of Lycia.
\p
\v 6 And there the centurion found a ship of Alexandria sailing for Italy; and he put us thereon.
\p
\v 7 And when we had sailed slowly many days, and were come with difficulty over against Cnidus, the wind not further suffering us, we sailed under Crete, over against Salmone;
\p
\v 8 And, coasting along it with difficulty, we came unto a place which is called Fair Havens; nigh whereunto was the city \add of\add* Lasea.
\p
\v 9 ¶ Now when much time was spent, and when sailing was now dangerous, because the Fast was now already past, Paul admonished \add them,\add* 
\p
\v 10 And said unto them, Sirs, I perceive that this voyage will be with disaster and much loss, not only of the lading and ship, but also of our lives.
\p
\v 11 Nevertheless the centurion believed the master and the owner of the ship, more than those things which were spoken by Paul.
\p
\v 12 And because the haven was not commodious to winter in, the more part advised to depart thence also, if by any means they might attain to Phoenix, \add and there\add* to winter; \add which is\add* a haven of Crete, and lieth toward the southwest and northwest.
\p
\v 13 And when the south wind blew softly, supposing that they had obtained \add their\add* purpose, loosing \add thence,\add* they sailed close by Crete.
\p
\v 14 But not long after there beat against it a tempestuous wind, called Euroclydon.
\p
\v 15 And when the ship was caught, and could not bear up into the wind, we let \add her\add* drive.
\p
\v 16 And running under a certain island which is called Clauda, we had much work to secure the boat;
\p
\v 17 Which when they had taken up, they used helps, undergirding the ship; and, fearing lest they should be cast upon Syrtis, they lowered the sail, and so were driven.
\p
\v 18 And we being exceedingly tossed with a tempest, the next \add day\add* they lightened the ship;
\p
\v 19 And the third \add day\add* they cast out with their own hands the tackling of the ship.
\p
\v 20 And when neither sun nor stars in many days appeared, and no small tempest lay on \add us,\add* all hope that we should be saved was then taken away.
\p
\v 21 And when they had been long without food, Paul stood forth in the midst of them, and said, Sirs, ye should have hearkened unto me, and not have loosed from Crete, and to have gained this harm and loss.
\p
\v 22 And now I exhort you to be of good cheer: for there shall be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship.
\p
\v 23 For there stood by me this night an angel of the God whose I am, and whom I serve,
\p
\v 24 Saying, Fear not, Paul; thou must be brought before Caesar: and, lo, God hath given thee all them that sail with thee.
\p
\v 25 Wherefore, sirs, be of good cheer, for I believe God, that it shall be even as it was told me.
\p
\v 26 Howbeit we must be cast upon a certain island.
\p
\v 27 But when the fourteenth night was come, as we were driven up and down in Adria, about midnight the sailors deemed that they drew near to some country;
\p
\v 28 And sounded, and found twenty fathoms; and when they had gone a little further, they sounded again, and found fifteen fathoms.
\p
\v 29 Then fearing lest we should have fallen upon rocks, they cast four anchors out of the stern, and wished for the day.
\p
\v 30 And as the sailors were seeking to flee out of the ship, and had lowered the boat into the sea, under colour as though they would have cast anchors out of the foreship,
\p
\v 31 Paul said to the centurion and to the soldiers, Except these abide in the ship, ye cannot be saved.
\p
\v 32 Then the soldiers cut off the ropes of the boat, and let her fall off.
\p
\v 33 And while the day was coming on, Paul besought \add them\add* all to take meat, saying, This day is the fourteenth day that ye have tarried and continued fasting, having taken nothing.
\p
\v 34 Wherefore I pray you to take some food; for this is for your safety; for there shall not an hair fall from the head of any of you.
\p
\v 35 And when he had thus spoken, he took bread, and gave thanks to God in presence of them all: and when he had broken it, he began to eat.
\p
\v 36 Then were they all of good cheer, and they also took food.
\p
\v 37 And we were in all in the ship two hundred threescore and sixteen souls.
\p
\v 38 And when they had eaten enough, they lightened the ship, casting out the wheat into the sea.
\p
\v 39 And when it was day, they did not recognize the land: but they discovered a certain bay, having a beach, into which they were minded, if it were possible, to thrust in the ship.
\p
\v 40 And when they had cut the anchors, they left them in the sea, and loosed the rudder bands, and hoisted up the foresail to the wind, and made toward shore.
\p
\v 41 And falling into a place where two seas met, they ran the ship aground; and the forepart stuck fast, and remained unmoveable, but the hinder part began to break up with the violence of the waves.
\p
\v 42 And the soldiers’ counsel was to kill the prisoners, lest any of them should swim out, and escape.
\p
\v 43 But the centurion, wishing to save Paul, kept them from \add their\add* purpose; and commanded that they that could swim should be the first to cast \add themselves into the sea,\add* and get to land,
\p
\v 44 And the rest, some on boards, and some on \add broken pieces\add* of the ship. And so it came to pass, that they all escaped safe to land.
\c 28
\cl CHAPTER 28
\p
\v 1 ¶ And having escaped, we discovered that the island was called Melita.
\p
\v 2 And the inhabitants showed us no little kindness: for they kindled a fire, and received us every one, because of the present rain, and because of the cold.
\p
\v 3 But when Paul had gathered a bundle of sticks, and laid \add them\add* on the fire, there came a viper out of the heat, and fastened on his hand.
\p
\v 4 And when the inhabitants saw the \add venomous\add* beast hang on his hand, they said among themselves, No doubt this man is a murderer, whom, though he hath escaped the sea, yet Justice suffereth not to live.
\p
\v 5 And he shook off the beast into the fire, and felt no harm.
\p
\v 6 Howbeit they expected that he would swell, or fall down dead suddenly, but after they had looked a great while, and saw no harm come to him, they changed their minds, and said that he was a god.
\p
\v 7 ¶ Now in the same region were possessions of the chief man of the island, whose name was Publius; who received us, and lodged us three days courteously.
\p
\v 8 And it came to pass, that the father of Publius lay sick of fever and dysentery; to whom Paul entered in, and prayed, and laid his hands on him, and healed him.
\p
\v 9 So when this was done, others also who had diseases in the island, came, and were healed;
\p
\v 10 Who also honoured us with many honours; and when we departed, they laded \add us\add* with such things as were necessary.
\p
\v 11 ¶ And after three months we departed in a ship of Alexandria, which had wintered in the isle, whose ensign was Castor and Pollux.
\p
\v 12 And landing at Syracuse, we tarried \add there\add* three days.
\p
\v 13 And from thence, going in a circuitous course, we came to Rhegium: and after one day the south wind blew, and we came the next day to Puteoli:
\p
\v 14 Where we found brethren, and were entreated to tarry with them seven days; and so we went toward Rome.
\p
\v 15 And from thence, when the brethren heard of us, they came to meet us as far as the Market of Appius and the Three Taverns, whom when Paul saw, he thanked God, and took courage.
\p
\v 16 And when we came to Rome, Paul was suffered to dwell by himself with the soldier that guarded him.
\p
\v 17 ¶ And it came to pass, that after three days Paul called the chief of the Jews together; and when they were come together, he said unto them: Brethren, though I have committed nothing against the people, or the customs of our fathers, yet was I delivered prisoner from Jerusalem into the hands of the Romans.
\p
\v 18 Who, when they had examined me, would have let \add me\add* go, because there was no cause of death in me.
\p
\v 19 But when the Jews spake against \add it,\add* I was constrained to appeal unto Caesar; not that I had aught to accuse my nation of.
\p
\v 20 For this cause therefore did I entreat you to see and speak with me; because that for the hope of Israel I am bound with this chain.
\p
\v 21 And they said unto him: We neither received letters out of Judaea concerning thee, neither did any of the brethren that came hither report or speak any harm of thee.
\p
\v 22 But we desire to hear of thee what thou thinkest; for as concerning this sect, we know that every where it is spoken against.
\p
\v 23 And when they had appointed him a day, there came many to him into \add his\add* lodging; to whom he expounded and testified the kingdom of God, persuading them concerning Jesus, both out of the law of Moses, and \add out of\add* the prophets, from morning till evening.
\p
\v 24 And some believed the things which were spoken, and some believed not.
\p
\v 25 And when they agreed not among themselves, they departed, after that Paul had spoken one word: Well spake the Holy Spirit through Isaiah the prophet unto our fathers,
\p
\v 26 Saying, Go unto this people, and say, Hearing ye shall hear, and shall not understand; and seeing ye shall see, and not perceive;
\p
\v 27 For the heart of this people is waxed gross, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes have they closed; lest they should see with \add their\add* eyes, and hear with \add their\add* ears, and understand with \add their\add* heart, and should turn again, and I should heal them.
\p
\v 28 Be it known therefore unto you, that the salvation of God is sent unto the Gentiles, and \add that\add* they will hear it.
\p
\v 29 And when he had said these words, the Jews departed, and had great reasoning among themselves.
\p
\v 30 ¶ And he dwelt two whole years in his own hired house, and received all that came in unto him,
\p
\v 31 Preaching the kingdom of God, and teaching the things concerning the Lord Jesus Christ, with all confidence, no one hindering him.
